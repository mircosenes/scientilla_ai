    "abstract": "Nanoparticles for cancer therapy and imaging are designed to accumulate in the diseased tissue by exploiting the Enhanced Permeability and Retention (EPR) effect. This limits their size to about 100 nm. Here, using intravital microscopy and elemental analysis, we compare the in vivo localization of particles with different geometries and demonstrate that plateloid particles preferentially accumulate within the tumor vasculature at unprecedented levels, independent of the EPR effect. In melanoma-bearing mice, 1000 × 400 nm plateloid particles adhered to the tumor vasculature at about 5% and 10% of the injected dose per gram organ (ID/g) for untargeted and RGD-targeted particles respectively, and exhibited the highest tumor-to-liver accumulation ratios (0.22 and 0.35). Smaller and larger plateloid particles, as well as cylindroid particles, were more extensively sequestered by the liver, spleen, and lungs. Plateloid particles appeared well-suited for taking advantage of hydrodynamic forces and interfacial interactions required for efficient tumoritropic accumulation, even without using specific targeting ligands. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

    "abstract": "The surge in the number of distributed microelectronics and sensors requires versatile, scalable, and affordable power sources. Heat-harvesting organic thermoelectric generators (TEGs) are regarded as potential key components of the future energy landscape. Recent advances in the performance of organic thermoelectric materials have made practical applications of organic TEGs more feasible than ever before, yet the challenges of designing and fabricating organic TEGs suitable for real scenarios are scarcely addressed. Specifically, small sensors and wearables demand for micro-thermoelectric generators (µTEGs) with high power density architectures and small form factors, while typical demonstrations of organic TEGs are characterized by < 10 thermocouples (TCs) per cm2. This work presents a rolled, organic µTEG architecture combining large-area, solution-based deposition techniques, such as inkjet and spray-coating, and an ultrathin parylene substrate to achieve a thermocouple density of 1842 TCs cm−2. Such demonstrative µTEG reaches a thermoelectric conversion performance of 0.15 µW cm−2 at ΔT = 50 K. Such power output is well in line with finite element method simulations, which highlight the benefit of the architecture and show that remarkable power densities, in the mW cm−2 range at ΔT = 10 K, are realistically achievable with geometrical improvements and already ongoing advancements in organic thermoelectric inks.",

Here, we show efficient solar cells based on mixed-halide (CsPbBrI2) NCs obtained via anion exchange reactions under ambient conditions. We performed anion exchange reactions in concentrated NC solutions with I-, thus inducing a PL red shift up to 676 nm and obtaining a high PLQY in film (65%). Solar cell devices operating in the wavelength range 350-660 nm were fabricated in air with two different deposition methods. The solar cells display a photoconversion efficiency of 5.3% and open circuit voltage (Voc) up to 1.31 V, among the highest reported for perovskite-based solar cells with band gap below 2 eV, clearly demonstrating the potential of this material.",

    "abstract": "Usually, positive neurological symptoms are considered as the consequence of a mere, afinalistic and abnormal increase in function of specific brain areas. However, according to the Theory of Active Inference, which argues that action and perception constitute a loop that updates expectations according to a Bayesian model, the brain is rather an explorer that formulates hypotheses and tests them to assess the correspondence between internal models and reality. Moreover, the cerebral cortex is characterised by a continuous “conflict” between different brain areas, which constantly attempt to expand in order to acquire more of the limited available computational resources, by means of their dopamine-induced neuroplasticity. Thus, it has recently been suggested that dreams, during rapid eye movement sleep (REMS), protect visual brain areas (deprived of their stimuli during rest) from being conquered by other normally stimulated ones. It is therefore conceivable that positive symptoms also have a functional importance for the brain. We evaluate supporting literature data of a ‘defensive’ role of positive symptoms and the relevance of dopamine-induced neuroplasticity in the context of neurodegenerative and psychiatric diseases. Furthermore, the possible functional significance of idiopathic REMS-related behavioural disorder as well as phantom limb syndrome is examined. We suggest that positive neurological symptoms are not merely a passive expression of a damage, but active efforts, related to dopamine-induced plasticity, to maintain a correct relationship between the external world and its brain representation, thus preventing healthy cortical areas from ousting injured ones.",

Evidence that αSyn is present in the cerebrospinal fluid and interstitial brain tissue and that healthy neuronal grafts transplanted into PD patients often degenerate suggests that extracellularly-released αSyn plays a role in triggering the neurodegenerative process. αSyn’s role in neurotransmission has been shown in various cell culture models in which the protein was upregulated or deleted and in knock out and transgenic animal, with different results on αSyn’s effect on synaptic vesicle pool size and mobilization, αSyn being proposed as a negative or positive regulator of neurotransmitter release. In this review, we discuss the effect of αSyn on pre- and post-synaptic compartments in terms of synaptic vesicle trafficking, calcium entry and channel activity, and we focus on the process of exocytosis and internalization of αSyn and on the spreading of αSyn-driven effects due to the presence of the protein in the extracellular milieu.",

While the basic properties of phage itself have been well described, the behavior of phage in an in vivo setting is not as well understood due to the complexity of the system. Here, we take a dual approach in describing the biophysical mechanisms and properties that contribute to the efficacy of in vivo phage targeting. We begin by considering the interaction between phage and target by applying a kinetic model of ligand-receptor complexation and internalization. The multivalent display of peptides on the pIII capsid of phage is also discussed as an augmenting factor in the binding affinity of phage-displayed peptides to cellular targets accessible in a microenvironment of interest. Lastly, we examine the physical properties of the total phage particle that facilitate improved delivery and targeting in vivo compared to free peptides.© 2010, Elsevier Inc.",

    "abstract": "The use of nanoparticles (NPs) can substantially improve the analytical performance of surface plasmon resonance imaging (SPRi) in general, and in DNA sensing in particular. In this work, we report on the modification of the gold surface of commercial biochips with gold nanospheres, silica-coated gold nanoshells, and silver nanoprisms, respectively. The NPs were tethered onto the surface of the chip and functionalized with a DNA probe. The effects of tethering conditions and varying nanostructures on the SPRi signals were evaluated via hybridization assays. The results showed that coupling between planar surface plasmons and electric fields, generated by localized surface plasmons of the NPs, is mandatory for signal enhancement. Silver nanoprisms gave the best results in improving the signal change at a target DNA concentration of <50 nM by +50 % (compared to a conventional SPRi chip). The limit of detection for the target DNA was 0.5 nM which is 5 times less than in conventional SPRi. [Figure not available: see fulltext.] © 2013 Springer-Verlag Wien.",

    "abstract": "Colloidal quantum dot (CQD) light-emitting diodes (LEDs) deliver a compelling performance in the visible, yet infrared CQD LEDs underperform their visible-emitting counterparts, largely due to their low photoluminescence quantum efficiency. Here we employ a ternary blend of CQD thin film that comprises a binary host matrix that serves to electronically passivate as well as to cater for an efficient and balanced carrier supply to the emitting quantum dot species. In doing so, we report infrared PbS CQD LEDs with an external quantum efficiency of ~7.9% and a power conversion efficiency of ~9.3%, thanks to their very low density of trap states, on the order of 1014 cm−3, and very high photoluminescence quantum efficiency in electrically conductive quantum dot solids of more than 60%. When these blend devices operate as solar cells they deliver an open circuit voltage that approaches their radiative limit thanks to the synergistic effect of the reduced trap-state density and the density of state modification in the nanocomposite.",

    "abstract": "A general technique to build a dynamic and distributed intrusion detector for a class of multi-agent systems is proposed in this paper, by which misbehavior in the motion of one or more agents can be discovered. Previous work from the authors has focused on how to distinguish the behavior of a misbehaving agent in a completely distributed way, by developing a solution where agents act as local monitors of their neighbors and use locally sensed information as well as data received from other monitors at a particular time. In this work, we improve the system detection capability by allowing monitors to use information collected at different instants and thus realizing a dynamic state observer that is valid for any system in the considered class. Finally, we show through simulations the effectiveness of the proposed solution for a case study. ©2009 IEEE.",

    "abstract": "Non-spherical nano-/micro-particles can drift laterally (hydrodynamic margination) in a linear laminar flow under the concurrent effect of hydrodynamic and inertial forces. Such a feature can be exploited in the rational design of particle-based intravascular and pulmonary delivery systems and for designing new flow fractioning systems for high-throughput particle separation. A general approach is presented to predict the marginating behavior of non-spherical particles. The lateral drift velocity is shown to depend on the particle Stokes number Sta and to grow with the size, density and rotational inertia of the particle. Elongated particles, in particular, low aspect ratio discoidal particles, exhibit the largest propensity to marginate in a linear laminar flow. In the blood microcirculation, at low shear rates (S<100s-1), non-spherical particles oscillate around their trajectory and margination can only be achieved through the application of external force fields (gravitational, magnetic); whereas for larger S (100s -1<S<104s-1), micrometer particles can achieve drift velocities in the order of 1-10νms-1. In the pulmonary circulation, hydrodynamic margination can be observed even for sub-micrometer particles. Finally, the inherent propensity of non-spherical particles to drift laterally can be effectively exploited for designing microfluidic devices, based on the flow fractioning approach, for particle separation without using external lateral force fields. © 2009 IOP Publishing Ltd.",

By leveraging the adaptability, dexterity, and gentle touch of soft robotic grippers, we can envision a future where delicate crops are efficiently and meticulously harvested with minimal damage. This study presents a novel fiberless soft pneumatic gripper inspired by plant structures, offering multifunctional capabilities such as coiling, bending, and elongation in a bidirectional manner. The actuator is equipped with embedded sensors for proprioception, allowing it to sense and respond to environmental stimuli. Experimental tests have characterized the actuator's actuation and sensing capabilities, highlighting its potential for a wide range of applications, including agricultural harvesting.

After protein separation by gel electrophoresis, the amount of radioactive phosphate incorporated from adenosine 5′‐[γ‐32P] triphosphate, tetra‐(ethylammonium) salt ([32P]ATP) was measured indirectly by auto‐radiography. The 21 most phosphorylated protein bands were then analysed by computerized image analysis. In the frontoparietal cortex no protein bands were significantly affected after cAMP‐induced back phosphorylation, while after Ca2+ stimulation there was a decreased incorporation of [32P]ATP in a 22,000 protein band. In the striatum there was a reduced incorporation of [32P]ATP in a 26,000 protein band after cAMP‐induced back phosphorylation, and in four bands of 20,000, 21,000, 52,000 and 134,000, respectively, after Ca2+ stimulation. The reduced incorporation of [32P]ATP in these proteins indicated increased original phosphorylation levels after toluene exposure. A comparison between the frontoparietal cortex and the striatum showed a selective vulnerability of phosphorylation processes in striatal membrane protein bands. In conclusion, toluene exposure at low doses augments membrane protein phosphorylation levels in the rat forebrain and especially in the striatum, probably leading to changes in information handling and/or metabolic changes. © 1987 Scandinavian Physiological Society",

Animals chronically treated with DOM did not present tolerance to a challenge dose of Haloperidol (HAL) and DOM either measuring PRL secretion or striatal DA metabolite levels. The PRL-induced incrase in hypothalamic 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) was reduced. These results were accompained by no change at striatal DA receptors, a slight reduction in density-affinity at hypothalamic DA receptors but clear-cut modification in pituitary DA receptors with the appearance of a high affinity-low capacity binding sites. It can be surmised that sustained hyperprolactinemia may induce tolerance in hypothalamic Tuberoinfundibular (TIDA) neurons involved in the inhibitory control of PRL secretion and a change in the kinetic properties of pituitary DA receptors, but it does not consistently affect the activity of the nigro-striatal DA system. © 1986 The Italian Pharmacological Society.",

We explore the pivotal role played by RNA sequence, structure, and chemical modifications in these processes, uncovering their correlation with crowding phenomena under physiological conditions. Additionally, we investigate instances where crowding deviates from its intended function, leading to pathological consequences. By deepening our understanding of the delicate balance that governs molecular crowding driven by RNA and its implications for cellular homeostasis, we aim to shed light on this intriguing area of research. Our exploration extends to the methodologies employed to decipher the composition and structural intricacies of RNA granules, offering a comprehensive overview of the techniques used to characterize them, including relevant computational approaches. Through two detailed examples highlighting the significance of noncoding RNAs, NEAT1 and XIST, in the formation of phase-separated assemblies and their influence on the cellular landscape, we emphasize their crucial role in cellular organization and function. By elucidating the chemical underpinnings of RNA-mediated molecular crowding, investigating the role of modifications, structures, and composition of RNA granules, and exploring both physiological and aberrant phase separation phenomena, this Review provides a multifaceted understanding of the intriguing world of RNA-mediated biological condensates.",

We report here on the development of a machine-learned interatomic potential for GST225 that allowed us to perform large scale molecular dynamics simulations (over 10,000 atoms for over 100 ns) to uncover the details of the crystallization kinetics in a wide range of temperatures of interest for the programming of the devices. The potential is obtained by fitting with a deep neural network (NN) scheme a large quantum-mechanical database generated within density functional theory.

Herein, we highlight the third method applied to carbon nanomaterials because it results in stable and concentrated systems without any other additives, and the deposited materials form conductive patterns after solvent drying without the need for post-treatments like (electro)chemical reduction or removal of passivating agents. Good solvents for exfoliating pristine materials have been ascribed as having the 'correct' match of Hansen solubility parameters. Although this approach successfully enhances the yield in terms of mass concentration, it does not explain the high stability of dispersions prepared in liquids ascribed as 'bad' solvents or some properties observed for exfoliated materials in both 'good' and 'bad' ones, like sedimentation. In this review, we have reinterpreted organic dispersions of pristine carbon materials using concepts of Colloidal Chemistry, which can explain many poorly understood properties and guide new improvements in this area.",

    "abstract": "The simulation of complex quantum many-body systems is a promising short-term goal of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. However, the limited connectivity of native qubits hinders the implementation of quantum algorithms that require long-range interactions. We present the outcomes of a digital quantum simulation where we overcome the limitations of the qubit connectivity in NISQ devices. Utilizing the universality of quantum processor native gates, we demonstrate how to implement couplings among physically disconnected qubits at the cost of increasing the circuit depth. We apply this method to simulate a Floquet-driven quantum spin chain featuring interactions beyond nearest neighbors. Specifically, we benchmark the prethermal stabilization of the discrete Floquet time-crystalline response as the interaction range increases, a phenomenon never observed experimentally. Our quantum simulation addresses one of the significant limitations of superconducting quantum processors, namely, device connectivity. It reveals that nontrivial physics involving couplings beyond nearest neighbors can be extracted after the impact of noise is properly taken into account in the theoretical model and consequently mitigated from the experimental data.",

    "abstract": "We introduce a novel random field Ising model, grounded on experimental observations, to assess the importance of metric correlations in cortical circuits in vitro. Metric correlations arise from both the finite axonal length and the heterogeneity in the spatial arrangement of neurons. The experiments consider the response of neuronal cultures to an external electric stimulation for a gradually weaker connectivity strength between neurons, and in cultures with different spatial configurations. The model can be analytically solved in the metric-free, mean-field scenario. The presence of metric correlations precipitates a strong deviation from the mean field. Null models of the same networks that preserve the distribution of connections recover the mean field. Our results show that metric-inherited correlations in spatial networks dominate the connectivity blueprint, mask the actual distribution of connections, and may emerge as the asset that shapes network dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive dysfunctions are core-enduring symptoms of schizophrenia, with important sex-related differences. Genetic variants of the DTBPN1 gene associated with reduced dysbindin-1 protein (Dys) expression negatively impact cognitive functions in schizophrenia through a functional epistatic interaction with Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT). Dys is involved in the trafficking of dopaminergic receptors, crucial for prefrontal cortex (PFC) signaling regulation. Moreover, dopamine signaling is modulated by estrogens via inhibition of COMT expression. We hypothesized a sex dimorphism in Dys-related cognitive functions dependent on COMT and estrogen levels. Our multidisciplinary approach combined behavioral-molecular findings on genetically modified mice, human postmortem Dys expression data, and in vivo fMRI during a working memory task performance. We found cognitive impairments in male mice related to genetic variants characterized by reduced Dys protein expression (pBonferroni = 0.0001), as well as in male humans through a COMT/Dys functional epistatic interaction involving PFC brain activity during working memory (t(23) = −3.21; pFDR = 0.004). Dorsolateral PFC activity was associated with lower working memory performance in males only (p = 0.04). Also, male humans showed decreased Dys expression in dorsolateral PFC during adulthood (pFDR = 0.05). Female Dys mice showed preserved cognitive performances with deficits only with a lack of estrogen tested in an ovariectomy model (pBonferroni = 0.0001), suggesting that genetic variants reducing Dys protein expression could probably become functional in females when the protective effect of estrogens is attenuated, i.e., during menopause. Overall, our results show the differential impact of functional variants of the DTBPN1 gene interacting with COMT on cognitive functions across sexes in mice and humans, underlying the importance of considering sex as a target for patient stratification and precision medicine in schizophrenia.",

    "abstract": "Transient absorption, or pump–probe microscopy is an absorption-based technique that can explore samples ultrafast dynamic properties and provide fluorescence-free contrast mechanisms. When applied to graphene and its derivatives, this technique exploits the graphene transient response caused by the ultrafast interband transition as the imaging contrast mechanism. The saturation of this transition is fundamental to allow for super-resolution optical far-field imaging, following the reversible saturable optical fluorescence transitions (RESOLFT) concept, although not involving fluorescence. With this aim, we propose a model to numerically compute the temporal evolution under saturation conditions of the single-layer graphene molecular states, which are involved in the transient absorption. Exploiting an algorithm based on the fourth order Runge–Kutta (RK4) method, and the density matrix approach, we numerically demonstrate that the transient absorption signal of single-layer graphene varies linearly as a function of excitation intensity until it reaches saturation. We experimentally verify this model using a custom pump–probe super-resolution microscope. The results define the intensities necessary to achieve super-resolution in a pump–probe nanoscope while studying graphene-based materials and open the possibility of predicting such a saturation process in other light-matter interactions that undergo the same transition.",

The chemisorption process involves dramatic atomic rearrangements in the crystalline state upon cleavage and formation of H-Cl, N-H, Cu-N, and Cu-Cl coordination and covalent bonds from the gas and solid state, respectively. Using mechanochemistry, the chloride-bridged coordination complex 1·MeOH is selectively produced by means of a dehydrochlorination reaction, but not in solution in which a mixture of 1·MeOH and 1·MeOH is obtained. 1·MeOH also via chemisorption and adsorption can trap HCl and MeOH to give the second sphere adduct 1′·MeOH. The adsorption process is confirmed by forming the second sphere adduct 1′·EtOH by exposing both 1·MeOH and 1·MeOH to HCl and ethanol. Quantum-mechanical (QM) calculations specific for solid phases give insights into the relative stabilities of the hybrid metal organic materials involved in the mechanochemical reaction producing selectively 1·MeOH, giving a good agreement with the experimental results.",

    "abstract": "Spinal Cord Injury (SCI) affects trunk control and determines altered or absent neuromuscular activity and sensory feedback below the lesioned spinal segment. The practice of sport or of any physical activity are key elements for improving the health and quality of life of people with SCI. Paralympic athletes overcome limits related to their injuries, achieving high neuromuscular control and coordination. Among the sports that have been adapted for people with disabilities, sit-skiing is a sport that requires good trunk control. However, there is a lack of instruments and protocols for its quantitative assessment. In this work we describe a robot-based protocol designed to assess trunk control and tested with two expert sit-skiers and eight unimpaired subjects. We used the robotic platform hunova® to evaluate both the active and the reactive component of trunk control through two different exercises. We investigated the strategy adopted by subjects to perform these exercises and the changes due to their repetition. All unimpaired subjects successfully completed the proposed protocol. The repetition of both exercises induced a learning process leading to differences in motor performance. Similar results could be observed also in the two athletes, whose performance was characterized by differences due to the severity of their lesion and their skiing skills.",

    "abstract": "In the emerging field of whole-brain imaging at single-cell resolution, which represents one of the new frontiers to investigate the link between brain activity and behavior, the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans offers one of the most characterized models for systems neuroscience. Whole-brain recordings consist of 3D time series of volumes that need to be processed to obtain neuronal traces. Current solutions for this task are either computationally demanding or limited to specific acquisition setups. Here, we propose See Elegans, a direct programming algorithm that combines different techniques for automatic neuron segmentation and tracking without the need for the RFP channel, and we compare it with other available algorithms. While outperforming them in most cases, our solution offers a novel method to guide the identification of a subset of head neurons based on position and activity. The built-in interface allows the user to follow and manually curate each of the processing steps. See Elegans is thus a simple-to-use interface aimed at speeding up the post-processing of volumetric calcium imaging recordings while maintaining a high level of accuracy and low computational demands.",

Ablation by nanosecond laser pulses at 248 nm is shown to result in an increase of photolysis yields and in the efficient formation of new products. In sharp contrast, photoproduct formation in the corresponding ablation with 500 fs pulses is well defined and limited. Thus, besides its well-acknowledged thermal advantage, fs ablation is shown to provide a high degree of control over the induced photochemical modifications.

    "abstract": "Here we investigate the role of charge trapping/recombination dynamics at halide interstitials, responsible for halide segregation, when wide-band gap perovskites are embodied in solar cells. Such dynamics can be either fast (picoseconds-nanoseconds) or slow (nanoseconds-μs) according to the oxidation state of the halide defect. When carriers accumulate within the perovskite, at open-circuit conditions, the trapping/recombination process having the slowest dynamics causes photo instability predominantly. When the solar cell is under a load, the device performances are mainly affected by the fast carrier trapping, depending on a direct competition between the trapping rate and the charge extraction efficiency. We show that by selectively passivating the defects correlated to fast carrier trappings, the solar cell operation and stability can be largely improved by improving the charge extraction. Thus, a deep knowledge of the chemical nature of defect activities and the corresponding electronic dynamics is crucial for maximizing the performance and stability of wide bandgap perovskite solar cells.",

Following irradiation at low fluences with nanosecond pulses, photolysis of the dopants is found to result in the formation of naphthalene-like photoproducts, whereas above the threshold additional products are observed. Based on concentration studies, these are tentatively ascribed to species containing two naphthyl groups. In close correspondence to the formation of the new species, the photolysis yields for both dopants are found to increase sharply above the threshold. Finally, the nature and extent of these photochemical effects is indicated to depend sensitively on the laser pulse width.

    "abstract": "Phengite samples (2M1 and 3T politypes) and a synthetic end-member muscovite specimen were studied by in situ high-temperature synchrotron radiation X-ray diffraction. The measured volume thermal expansion of 2M1 phengite (<αV> ≈ 36.6 × 10-6 K-1) was systematically greater than <αV> of the 3T polytype (≈33.3 × 10-6 K-1). A positive linear correlation between the average thermal expansion on (001) plane and the mean tetrahedral rotation angle at ambient condition is proposed on the ground of new measurements and literature data. Dehydroxylation processes were observed in 2M1, starting at 1,000 K in 3T at 800 and 945 K in synthetic muscovite. Rietveld refinements allowed a determination of structural variations upon heating of phengite samples and their dehydroxylate phases. The phengite structure expands by regularizing the tetrahedral sheet and by reducing the bond length differences between the outer and inner coordination shell of the interlayer site. The dehydroxylate phase derived from 2M1 is characterized by fivefold polyhedra in the low temperature form as a consequence of two OH groups reacting to form H2O + O (residual). The dehydroxylate exhibits an increase of the cation-cation distances along the M-Or-M bonds with respect to low-temperature phengite structures. For the 3T phase, we were unable to achieve completion of dehydroxylation. The refined structural model of the dehydroxylate phase shows two hydroxyl sites, but at a short distance from one another. This result suggests that the dehydroxylation reaction did not proceed to completion. © Springer-Verlag 2008.",

    "abstract": "Proteins are crucial in regulating every aspect of RNA life, yet understanding their interactions with coding and noncoding RNAs remains limited. Experimental studies are typically restricted to a small number of cell lines and a limited set of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). Although computational methods based on physico-chemical principles can predict protein-RNA interactions accurately, they often lack the ability to consider cell-type-specific gene expression and the broader context of gene regulatory networks (GRNs). Here, we assess the performance of several GRN inference algorithms in predicting protein-RNA interactions from single-cell transcriptomic data, and propose a pipeline, called scRAPID (single-cell transcriptomic-based RnA Protein Interaction Detection), that integrates these methods with the catRAPID algorithm, which can identify direct physical interactions between RBPs and RNA molecules. Our approach demonstrates that RBP-RNA interactions can be predicted from single-cell transcriptomic data, with performances comparable or superior to those achieved for the well-established task of inferring transcription factor-target interactions. The incorporation of catRAPID significantly enhances the accuracy of identifying interactions, particularly with long noncoding RNAs, and enables the identification of hub RBPs and RNAs. Additionally, we show that interactions between RBPs can be detected based on their inferred RNA targets. The software is freely available at https://github.com/tartaglialabIIT/scRAPID.",

    "abstract": "In this work, carbon nanofibers were used as doping material to develop a highly conductive chitosan-based composite. Scaffolds based on chitosan only and chitosan/carbon composites were prepared by precipitation. Carbon nanofibers were homogeneously dispersed throughout the chitosan matrix, and the composite scaffold was highly porous with fully interconnected pores. Chitosan/carbon scaffolds had an elastic modulus of 28.1 ± 3.3 KPa, similar to that measured for rat myocardium, and excellent electrical properties, with a conductivity of 0.25 ± 0.09 S/m. The scaffolds were seeded with neonatal rat heart cells and cultured for up to 14 days, without electrical stimulation. After 14 days of culture, the scaffold pores throughout the construct volume were filled with cells. The metabolic activity of cells in chitosan/carbon constructs was significantly higher as compared to cells in chitosan scaffolds. The incorporation of carbon nanofibers also led to increased expression of cardiac-specific genes involved in muscle contraction and electrical coupling. This study demonstrates that the incorporation of carbon nanofibers into porous chitosan scaffolds improved the properties of cardiac tissue constructs, presumably through enhanced transmission of electrical signals between the cells. © 2014 American Chemical Society.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies have shown that α-amylase and lipase are capable of enhancing the degradation of fiber meshes blends of starch and poly(ε-caprolactone) (SPCL) under dynamic conditions, and consequently to promote the proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow stromal cells (MSCs). This study investigated the effect of flow perfusion bioreactor culture in combination with enzymes on the osteogenic differentiation of MSCs. SPCL fiber meshes were seeded with MSCs and cultured with osteogenic medium supplemented with α-amylase, lipase, or a combination of the two for 8 or 16 days using static or flow conditions. Lipase and its combination with α-amylase enhanced cell proliferation after 16 days. In addition, the flow perfusion culture enhanced the infiltration of cells and facilitated greater distribution of extracellular matrix (ECM) throughout the scaffolds in the presence/absence of enzymes. A significant amount of calcium was detected after 16 days in all groups cultured in flow conditions compared with static cultures. Nevertheless, when α-amylase and lipase were included in the flow perfusion cultures, the calcium content was 379 ± 30 μg/scaffold after as few as 8 days. The highest calcium content (1271 ± 32 μg/scaffold) was obtained for SPCL/cell constructs cultured for 16 days in the presence of lipase and flow. Furthermore, von Kossa staining and tetracycline fluorescence of histological sections demonstrated mineral deposition within the scaffolds for all groups cultured for 16 days under flow. However, all the data corroborate that lipase coupled with flow perfusion conditions improve the osteogenic differentiation of MSCs and enhance ECM mineralization. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Ewing sarcoma (EWS) is an aggressive bone tumor of uncertain cellular origin. CD99 is a membrane protein that is expressed in most cases of EWS, although its function in the disease is unknown. Here we have shown that endogenous CD99 expression modulates EWS tumor differentiation and malignancy. We determined that knocking down CD99 expression in human EWS cell lines reduced their ability to form tumors and bone metastases when xenografted into immunodeficient mice and diminished their tumorigenic characteristics in vitro. Further, reduction of CD99 expression resulted in neurite outgrowth and increased expression of β-III tubulin and markers of neural differentiation. Analysis of a panel of human EWS cells revealed an inverse correlation between CD99 and H-neurofilament expression, as well as an inverse correlation between neural differentiation and oncogenic transformation. As knockdown of CD99 also led to an increase in phosphorylation of ERK1/2, we suggest that the CD99-mediated prevention of neural differentiation of EWS occurs through MAPK pathway modulation. Together, these data indicate a new role for CD99 in preventing neural differentiation of EWS cells and suggest that blockade of CD99 or its downstream molecular pathway may be a new therapeutic approach for EWS.",

    "abstract": "Cationic antimicrobial peptides (CAMPs) are very promising in the treatment of multi-drug resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa lung infections experienced by cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. Nevertheless, there is an urgent need of inhalable formulations able to deliver the intact CAMP in conductive airways and to shield its interactions with airway mucus/bacterial biofilm, thus enhancing CAMP/bacteria interactions. Along these lines, the aim of this work was the design and development of nano-embedded microparticles (NEM) for sustained delivery of CAMPs in the lung. To this purpose, nanoparticles (NPs) made of poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) containing a model CAMP, colistin (Col), were produced by emulsion/solvent diffusion technique. Engineering NPs with chitosan (CS) and poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) allowed to modulate surface properties and, in so doing, to improve NP transport through artificial CF mucus. In order to achieve a long-term stable dosage form useful for NP inhalation, NPs were spray-dried in different carriers (lactose or mannitol), thus producing NEM. The most promising NEM formulations were selected on the basis of bulk and flow properties, distribution of NPs in the carrier and aerosolization performance upon delivery through a breath-actuated dry powder inhaler. Of note, selected Col-loaded NEM were found to kill P. aeruginosa biofilm and to display a prolonged efficacy in biofilm eradication compared to the free Col. This effect was likely ascribable to the ability of NPs to penetrate into bacterial biofilm, as demonstrated by confocal analysis, and to sustain Col release inside it. Taken all together, our results indicate that adequate engineering of PLGA NPs represents an enticing technological approach to harness novel antimicrobials for P. aeruginosa lung infection, such as CAMPs, especially in CF.",

Comprehension of the physics underlying this interaction may reveal further means of fine-tuning their optoelectronic response. Here, we investigate in depth charge-lattice interactions associated with the formation of polarons in different models of the prototypical CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite through advanced electronic structure calculations. We demonstrate that charge localization, while induced by the disordered dipolar field of the organic cations, is stabilized by distortions in the inorganic sublattice. Polaron hopping between neighboring minima is related to the random reorientation of the organic cations and occurs via a delocalized transition state. Our simulations highlight a struggle between thermally induced disorder, driven by the motion of A-site cations, and polaron stabilization within the BX3 sublattice, which explains the simultaneous low mobility and high diffusion length of charge carriers in lead halide perovskites.",

We show that both protein levels and cellular localization of prelamin A are modulated during myoblast activation. Similar changes of lamin A-binding proteins emerin and LAP2α were observed. Furthermore, prelamin A was found in a complex with LAP2α in differentiating myoblasts. Prelamin A accumulation in cycling myoblasts by expressing unprocessable mutants affected LAP2α and PCNA amount and increased caveolin 3 mRNA and protein levels, while accumulation of prelamin A in differentiated muscle cells following treatment with a farnesyl transferase inhibitor appeared to inhibit caveolin 3 expression.

This long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) localizes to nuclear speckles, where it interacts with a subset of splicing factors and modulates their activity. In this study, we demonstrate that oncogenic splicing factor SRSF1 bridges MALAT1 to mutant p53 and ID4 proteins in breast cancer cells. Mutant p53 and ID4 delocalize MALAT1 from nuclear speckles and favor its association with chromatin. This enables aberrant recruitment of MALAT1 on VEGFA pre-mRNA and modulation of VEGFA isoforms expression. Interestingly, VEGFA-dependent expression signatures associate with ID4 expression specifically in basal-like breast cancers carrying TP53 mutations. Our results highlight a key role for MALAT1 in control of VEGFA isoforms expression in breast cancer cells expressing gain-of-function mutant p53 and ID4 proteins.",

The neutron scattering allows one to extend these measurements to a much better resolution, showing an additional quasielastic signal in the melt. The results suggest x-ray measurements at higher momentum transfer, to see whether they are complementary to neutrons. © 1999 The American Physical Society.",

    "abstract": "Workers in industries are prone to injuries and musculoskeletal disorders when performing normal tasks. A potential solution to alleviate this situation is the use of back-support industrial exoskeletons in the workplace. These wearable devices consist of electrical actuators, sensors, and controllers that produce appropriate assistive forces when workers complete their activities. The technological integration of different active components in the exoskeleton creates a complex system with multiple strategies to achieve the force modulation produced by the system. In these scenarios, it is important to open some domains of the exoskeleton to the user to initialize the system, calibrate the exoskeleton, introduce user personal information (such as weight and height), and modify the controller parameters. The work presented in this study shows the assessment of the monitor system interface, which is a graphical user interface that allows the user to interact directly with the exoskeleton domains with easy adjustments. XoTrunk is an active industrial exoskeleton designed for carrying and lifting tasks. The controller architecture permits adequate force modulation according to the user action with an adjustable control strategy from the monitor system interface. Experiments were conducted with 12 participants in a standard lifting action wearing the exoskeleton. The results showed that the monitor system interface is a useful tool for human-robot interaction. The current version of the interface grants the user access to the exoskeleton domains previously mentioned.",

    "abstract": "The predominant use of synthetic materials, such as fiberglass and polymeric foams, for thermal and acoustic insulation in the construction sector contributes to the recalcitrant waste accumulation in the environment and is not economically sustainable in the long term. This is because they are developed with linear economy standards, they are neither reusable nor recyclable, and, at their end of lifecycle, they are not compostable, with a great amount of them finishing in landfills. This work is focused on the development of natural, self-growing mycelium-biocomposites as sustainable alternatives to these conventional synthetic materials. Specifically, fungal mycelium derived from the nonpathogenic fungal strain Pleurotus ostreatus is fed by coffee silverskin flakes, a lignocellulosic agrowaste from roasted coffee seeds, forming 3D biocomposites. The physicochemical properties of the obtained composite are thoroughly investigated, with a final focus on their thermal and acoustic insulation properties. As proved, the natural agrowaste-mycelium composites possess high porosity and thus low density, good thermal properties, and satisfactory sound absorption capability. Such properties combined with the minimal energetic requirements for their growth and their fully compostable end-of-life nature make them valuable alternatives for thermal and acoustic insulation in building construction, among other applications, promoting environmental and economic sustainability.",

We compared these structures to different hydrogenated and non-hydrogenated graphene oxide derivatives, with high level of epoxide and hydroxyl groups functionalization. Based on our calculations, stable phases of hydroxylated graphane with low and high contents of hydrogen are demonstrated for high oxygen and hydrogen partial pressure, respectively.

Structural and morphological characterizations evidenced the formation of nanocomposite sheets, with iron oxide nanoparticles integrated in the graphene matrix. Physico-chemical analysis revealed the functionalization of the graphene also by the presence of nitrogen atoms that show synergistic catalysis effects with Fe2O3.

    "abstract": "We retrospectively analyzed data from 15 patients, with a normal pre-operative cognitive performance, undergoing awake surgery for left fronto-temporal low-grade glioma. We combined a pre-surgical measure (fMRI maps of motor- and language-related centers) with intra-surgical measures (MNI-registered cortical sites data obtained during intra-operative direct electrical stimulation, DES, while they performed the two most common language tasks: number counting and picture naming). Selective DES effects along the precentral gyrus/inferior frontal gyrus (and/or the connected speech articulation network) were obtained. DES of the precentral gyrus evoked the motor speech arrest, i.e., anarthria (with apparent mentalis muscle movements). We calculated the number of shared voxels between the lip-tongue and overt counting related- and silent naming-related fMRI maps and the Volumes of Interest (VOIs) obtained by merging together the MNI sites at which a given speech disturbance was observed, normalized on their mean the values (i.e., Z score). Both tongue- and lips-related movements fMRI maps maximally overlapped (Z = 1.05 and Z = 0.94 for lips and tongue vs. 0.16 and −1.003 for counting and naming) with the motor speech arrest seed. DES of the inferior frontal gyrus, pars opercularis and the rolandic operculum induced speech arrest proper (without apparent mentalis muscle movements). This area maximally overlapped with overt counting-related fMRI map (Z = −0.11 and Z = 0.09 for lips and tongue vs. 0.9 and 0.0006 for counting and naming). Interestingly, our fMRI maps indicated reduced Broca's area activity during silent speech compared to overt speech. Lastly, DES of the inferior frontal gyrus, pars opercularis and triangularis evoked variations of the output, i.e., dysarthria, a motor speech disorder occurring when patients cannot control the muscles used to produce articulated sounds (phonemes). Silent object naming-related fMRI map maximally overlapped (Z = −0.93 and Z = −1.04 for lips and tongue vs. −1.07 and 0.99 for counting and naming) with this seed. Speech disturbances evoked by DES may be thought of as selective interferences with specific recruitment of left inferior frontal gyrus and precentral cortex which are differentiable in terms of the specific interference induced.",

    "abstract": "Efficient ionic transport in nanoporous carbon electrodes is pivotal for the development of high-rate electrochemical capacitive energy storage in supercapacitors (SCs). Over the past decade, the understanding of the charging/discharging mechanisms in nanostructured carbon electrodes and the elucidation of confinement and desolvation of ions in electrically charged carbon nanopores have spurred the development of advanced SCs holding ever-increasing energy density. Crucially, these advancements have to be accomplished without sacrificing the extraordinary power handling and cycling lifetime of the SC. In this work, we investigated the interaction between single-/few-layer graphene (SLG/FLG) flakes or activated carbon (AC) films and 1 M tetraethylammonium tetrafluoroborate (TEABF4) in propylene carbonate (PC) by lateral force microscopy (LFM) measurements. We unravel that the electrolyte nanotribology on SLG/FLG flakes incorporated into AC-based electrodes is effective at boosting the power performance of commercial-like SCs (active material mass loading ∼10 mg cm-2), thus maximizing the advantage of using nanoporous nanocarbon electrodes with high energy density. At a charge/discharge (CD) current density of 0.1 A g-1, our hybrid AC:SLG/FLG-based SC shows a 30% increase of specific capacitance (Cg) compared to the reference device, i.e., the AC-based one (Cg from 76.8 F g-1 to 98.2 F g-1). At higher CD current densities (>1 A g-1), the AC-based device displays a resistive behaviour, while the AC:SLG/FLG-based SCs still exhibit a Cg of 23.9 and 5.2 F g-1 at CD current densities as high as 2.5 and 5 A g-1, respectively. Beyond the control of the nanoporosity of carbon materials and the inter-ionic interaction of the electrolytes, the rationalization of the relationship between the nanotribology of nanocarbons and the performance of the corresponding SCs offers new opportunities to optimize the SC design compatibly with established high-throughput industrial manufacturing.",

    "abstract": "Background: Post-translational histone modifications are among the most common epigenetic modifications that orchestrate gene expression, playing a pivotal role during embryonic development and in various pathological conditions. Among histone lysine demethylases, KDM7A, also known as KIAA1718 or JHDM1D, catalyzes the demethylation of H3K9me1/2 and H3K27me1/2, leading to transcriptional regulation. Previous data suggest that KDM7A plays a central role in several biological processes, including cell proliferation, commitment, differentiation, apoptosis, and maintenance. However, information on the expression pattern of KDM7A in whole organisms is limited, and its functional role is still unclear. Results: In Xenopus development, kdm7a is expressed early, undergoing spatiotemporal regulation in various organs and tissues, including the central nervous system and the eye. Focusing on retinal development, we found that kdm7a overexpression does not affect the expression of genes critically involved in early neural development and eye-field specification, whereas unbalances the distribution of neural cell subtypes in the mature retina by disfavoring the development of ganglion cells while promoting that of horizontal cells. Conclusions: Kdm7a is dynamically expressed during embryonic development, and its overexpression influences late retinal development, suggesting a potential involvement in the molecular machinery regulating the spatiotemporally ordered generation of retinal neuronal subtypes.",

    "abstract": "Inhaled antivirulence drugs are currently considered a promising therapeutic option to treat Pseudomonas aeruginosa lung infections in cystic fibrosis (CF). We have recently shown that the anthelmintic drug niclosamide (NCL) has strong quorum sensing (QS) inhibiting activity against P. aeruginosa and could be repurposed as an antivirulence drug. In this work, we developed dry powders containing NCL nanoparticles that can be reconstituted in saline solution to produce inhalable nanosuspensions. NCL nanoparticles were produced by high-pressure homogenization (HPH) using polysorbate 20 or polysorbate 80 as stabilizers. After 20 cycles of HPH, all formulations showed similar properties in the form of needle-shape nanocrystals with a hydrodynamic diameter of approximately 450 nm and a zeta potential of -20 mV. Nanosuspensions stabilized with polysorbate 80 at 10% w/w to NCL (T80-10) showed an optimal solubility profile in simulated interstitial lung fluid. T80-10 was successfully dried into mannitol-based dry powder by spray drying. Dry powder (T80-10 DP) was reconstituted in saline solution and showed optimal in vitro aerosol performance. Both T80-10 and T80-10 DP were able to inhibit P. aeruginosa QS at NCL concentrations of 2.5-10 μM. NCL, and these formulations did not significantly affect the viability of CF bronchial epithelial cells in vitro at microbiologically active concentrations (i.e., ≤10 μM). In vivo acute toxicity studies in rats confirmed no observable toxicity of the NCL T80-10 DP formulation upon intratracheal administration at a concentration 100-fold higher than the anti-QS activity concentration. These preliminary results suggest that NCL repurposed in the form of inhalable nanosuspensions has great potential for the local treatment of P. aeruginosa lung infections as in the case of CF patients.",

We invited researchers to share knowledge and research on how humans and animals develop sensing, reasoning, and actions, and how to exploit robots as research tools to test models of development and learning. We expected the submitted contributions to emphasize the interaction with social and physical environments and how cognitive and developmental capabilities can be transferred to computing systems and robotics.

This study analyses seventeenth century handwritten historical letters stored at the Correr Museum Library in Venice, Italy, exhibiting pronounced signs of biodeterioration. The techniques used encompassed traditional colony isolation on agar plates and proteomics analyses, employing nanoscale liquid chromatography coupled with high-resolution mass spectrometry (nano-LC–MS). Fluorescence microscopy was used for the first time in the historical paper biodeterioration context to supplement the conventional stereoscopic, optical, and scanning electron microscopic imaging techniques. This method enables the visualisation of microorganisms beyond and beneath the paper’s surface through their natural intrinsic autofluorescence in a non-invasive and non-destructive way. The results demonstrate a diverse, complex, and abundant microbiota composed of coexisting fungal and bacterial species (Ascomycota, Mucoromycota, Basidiomycota, Proteobacteria, and Actinobacteria), along with mite carcasses, insects, parasites, and possibly protists. Furthermore, this study reveals certain species that were not previously documented in the biodeterioration of historical paper, including human pathogens, such as Histoplasma capsulatum, Brucella, Candida albicans, and species of Aspergillus (A. flavus, A. fumigatus, A. oryzae, A. terreus, A. niger) known to cause infections or produce mycotoxins, posing substantial risk to both artefacts and humans.",

We analyze and interpret arm and forearm muscle activity in relation with the kinematics of hand pre-shaping during reaching and grasping from the perspective of human synergistic motor control. Approach. Ten subjects performed six tasks involving reaching, grasping and object manipulation. We recorded electromyographic (EMG) signals from arm and forearm muscles with a mix of bipolar electrodes and high-density grids of electrodes. Motion capture was concurrently recorded to estimate hand kinematics. Muscle synergies were extracted separately for arm and forearm muscles, and postural synergies were extracted from hand joint angles. We assessed whether activation coefficients of postural synergies positively correlate with and can be regressed from activation coefficients of muscle synergies. Each type of synergies was clustered across subjects. Main results. We found consistency of the identified synergies across subjects, and we functionally evaluated synergy clusters computed across subjects to identify synergies representative of all subjects. We found a positive correlation between pairs of activation coefficients of muscle and postural synergies with important functional implications. We demonstrated a significant positive contribution in the combination between arm and forearm muscle synergies in estimating hand postural synergies with respect to estimation based on muscle synergies of only one body segment, either arm or forearm (p < 0.01). We found that dimensionality reduction of multi-muscle EMG root mean square (RMS) signals did not significantly affect hand posture estimation, as demonstrated by comparable results with regression of hand angles from EMG RMS signals. Significance. We demonstrated that hand posture prediction improves by combining activity of arm and forearm muscles and we evaluate, for the first time, correlation and regression between activation coefficients of arm muscle and hand postural synergies. Our findings can be beneficial for myoelectric control of hand prosthesis and upper-limb exoskeletons, and for biomarker evaluation during neurorehabilitation.",

    "abstract": "We discuss the origin of the low friction observed for some elastically soft materials, such as hydrogels and the human cartilage. When a soft elastic solid is squeezed against another solid in a fluid, if the nominal contact pressure is high enough, after long enough contact time the contact area percolates, resulting in islands of confined fluid. For charged surfaces, with charges of equal sign, the osmotic pressure in the area of “real contact” may be large enough to keep the surfaces separated at nanometer separation. In this case the solid contact pressure (here the osmotic pressure) in the area of “real contact” will be nearly independent of the external load. The finite surface separation in the area of “real contact” results in a very small (breakloose) friction force even after long time of stationary contact.",

    "abstract": "5G is being deployed and B5G connectivity is under study and standardization. Benefits brought by the 5G/B5G air interface are numerous and 5G is more than just an evolution of radio technology since it consists of innovative concepts: the application of network softwarization and programmability paradigms to the overall network design, the reduced latency promised by edge computing, or the concept of network slicing. These innovations open the door to new vertical-specific services, even capable of saving more lives. The paper describes four use cases to demonstrate the large-scale trialing of the B5G technology specifically devoted to eHealth and Emergency domains, by supporting the B5G applications in large-scale environments (e.g., hospitals) and bringing novel applications (e.g., Remote Proctoring and Smart Ambulance) and on societal benefits in eHealth and Emergency areas through the development of innovative B5G/6G applications. The work is a part of a more complete behavior, TrialsNet project, within SNS JU European Commission Programme, considering other field of application of B5G connectivity.",

    "abstract": "Proximal methods have recently been shown to provide effective optimization procedures to solve the variational problems defining the ℓ1 regularization algorithms. The goal of the paper is twofold. First we discuss how proximal methods can be applied to solve a large class of machine learning algorithms which can be seen as extensions of ℓ1 regularization, namely structured sparsity regularization. For all these algorithms, it is possible to derive an optimization procedure which corresponds to an iterative projection algorithm. Second, we discuss the effect of a preconditioning of the optimization procedure achieved by adding a strictly convex functional to the objective function. Structured sparsity algorithms are usually based on minimizing a convex (not strictly convex) objective function and this might lead to undesired unstable behavior. We show that by perturbing the objective function by a small strictly convex term we often reduce substantially the number of required computations without affecting the prediction performance of the obtained solution. © 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",

    "abstract": "Energy-harvesting technologies offer a sustainable, maintenance-free alternative to conventional energy-storage solutions in distributed low-power applications. Flexible thermoelectric generators (TEGs) can generate electric power from a temperature gradient, even on complex surfaces. Organic materials are ideal candidates for flexible TEGs due to their good solution-processability, natural abundance, low weight, and flexibility. Electronic and thermoelectric properties of organic materials have steadily progressed, while device architectures leveraging their advantages are largely missing. Here, a design and fabrication method are proposed for producing fully screen-printed, flexible monolithic organic TEGs scalable up to m2, compatible with any screen-printable ink. This approach is validated, along with its scalability, by printing TEGs composed of two different active inks, in three configurations, with up to 800 thermoelements, with performances well matching simulations based on materials parameters. It is demonstrated that by using an additive-free graphene ink, a remarkable power density of 15 nW cm−2 at ΔT = 29.5 K can be achieved, with an estimated weight-normalized power output of 1 µW g−1, highlighting a strong potential in portability. Owing to such power density, only limited areas are required to generate microwatts, sufficient for operating low-power electronic devices such as sensors, and wearables.",

    "abstract": "The homeobox-containing transcription factor Engrailed-2 (En2) is involved in patterning and neuronal differentiation of the midbrain/hindbrain region, where it is prominently expressed. En2 mRNA is also expressed in the adult mouse hippocampus and cerebral cortex, indicating that it might also function in these brain areas. Genome-wide association studies revealed that En2 is a candidate gene for autism spectrum disorders (ASD), and mice devoid of its expression (En2-/- mice) display anatomical, behavioral and clinical \"autistic-like\" features. Since reduced GABAergic inhibition has been proposed as a possible pathogenic mechanism of ASD, we hypothesized that the phenotype of En2-/- mice might include defective GABAergic innervation in the forebrain. Here we show that the Engrailed proteins are present in postnatal GABAergic neurons of the mouse hippocampus and cerebral cortex, and adult En2-/- mice show reduced expression of GABAergic marker mRNAs in these areas. In addition, reduction in parvalbumin (PV), somatostatin (SOM) and neuropeptide Y (NPY) expressing interneurons is detected in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex of adult En2-/- mice. Our results raise the possibility of a link between altered function of En2, anatomical deficits of GABAergic forebrain neurons and the pathogenesis of ASD. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.",

    "abstract": "The present work studies the influence of hydrolytic enzymes (α-amylase or lipase) on the degradation of fiber mesh scaffolds based on a blend of starch and poly(-caprolactone) (SPCL) and the osteogenic differentiation of osteogenic medium-expanded rat bone marrow stromal cells (MSCs) and subsequent formation of extracellular matrix on these scaffolds under static culture conditions. The biodegradation profile of SPCL fiber meshes was investigated using enzymes that are specifically responsible for the enzymatic hydrolysis of SPCL using concentrations similar to those found in human serum. These degradation studies were performed under static and dynamic conditions. After several degradation periods (3, 7, 14, 21, and 30 days), weight loss measurements and micro-computed tomography analysis (specifically porosity, interconnectivity, mean pore size, and fiber thickness) were performed. The SPCL scaffolds were seeded with rat MSCs and cultured for 8 and 16 days using complete osteogenic media with and without enzymes (α-amylase or lipase). Results indicate that culture medium supplemented with enzymes enhanced cell proliferation after 16 days of culture, whereas culture medium without enzymes did not. No calcium was detected in groups cultured with α-amylase or without enzymes after each time period, although groups cultured with lipase presented calcium deposition after the eighth day, showing a significant increase at the sixteenth day. Lipase appears to positively influence osteoblastic differentiation of rat MSCs and to enhance matrix mineralization. Furthermore, scanning electron microscopy images showed that the enzymes did not have a deleterious effect on the three-dimensional structure of SPCL fiber meshes, meaning that the scaffolds did not lose their structural integrity after 16 days. Confocal micrographs have shown cells to be evenly distributed and infiltrated within the SPCL fiber meshes up to 410 μm from the surface. This study demonstrates that supplementation of culture media with lipase holds great potential for the generation of bone tissue engineering constructs from MSCs seeded onto SPCL fiber meshes, because lipase enhances the osteoblastic differentiation of the seeded MSCs and promotes matrix mineralization without harming the structural integrity of the meshes over 16 days of culture. © 2009, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Commonly used risk indexes, such as the NIOSH Lifting Index, do not capture the effect of exoskeletons. This makes it difficult for Health and Safety professionals to rigorously assess the benefit of such devices. The community requires a simple method to assess the effectiveness of back-support exoskeleton's (BSE) in possibly reducing ergonomic risk. The method introduced in this work is termed “Equivalent Weight” (EqW) and it proposes an interpretation of the effect built on the benefit delivered through reduced activation of the erector spinae (ES). This manifests itself as an apparent reduction of the lifted load perceived by the wearer. This work presents a pilot study where a practical application of the EqW method is used to assess the ergonomic risk in manual material handling (MMH) when using a back support exoskeleton (StreamEXO). The results are assessed by combining observational measurements from on-site testing with five different workers and quantitative measures of the muscle activity reduction achieved during laboratory evaluation with ten workers. These results will show that when lifting, lowering, and carrying a 19 kg load the StreamEXO can reduce risk by up to two levels (from “high” to “low”) in the target sub-tasks. The Lifting index (LI) was reduced up to 64% when examining specific sub-tasks and the worker's movement conduction.",

Optical sectioning confocal microscopy has been used for studying the spatial distribution of the pigment in the cell body, surprisingly showing that, besides its expected presence in the cortical region immediately below the cell membrane, it is located in the cilia too. In order to ascertain possible differences in the pigment fluorescence properties along the cell body, we have measured emission spectra from different parts of it (anterior, posterior, and cilia). Our results clearly indicate that in all cases the spectra are the same, within experimental errors. Finally, we have evaluated the pigment relative fluorescence efficiency of these ciliates. In an ordered scale from lower to greater efficiency, we have S. coeruleus, B. japonicum blue, B. japonicum red, and F. salina. The possible implications of our findings for the process of photosensory transduction are discussed. © 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

    "abstract": "In this paper the use of topological clustering for decoding population neuronal responses and reducing stimulus features is described. The discrete spike trains, recorded in rat somatosensory cortex in response to sinusoidal vibrissal stimulations characterised by different frequencies and amplitudes, are first interpreted to continuous temporal activities by convolving with a decaying exponential filter. Then the self-organising map is utilised to cluster the continuous responses. The result is a topologically ordered clustering of the responses with respect to the stimuli. The clustering is formed mainly along the product of amplitude and frequency of the stimuli. Such grouping agrees with the energy coding result obtained previously based on spike counts and mutual information. To further investigate how the clustering preserves information, the mutual information between resulting stimulus grouping and responses has been calculated. The cumulative mutual information of the clustering resembles closely that of the energy grouping. It suggests that topological clustering can naturally find underlying stimulus-response patterns and preserve information among the clusters. © 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",

Epoxidized soybean oil (ESO), vanillin, the biobased diamine, Priamine®, and oleic acid were used to create a material that can replace fossil-derived, non-biodegradable packaging. Vanillin and Priamine® were used to develop a crosslinker that could react with the epoxide groups of ESO without the need for solvents, with a catalyst-free synthesis that does not generate any waste or byproducts. Oleic acid was incorporated, to tune the properties of the final material, since it can react with ESO and control the crosslink density. The vitrimers produced in this work showed excellent reprocessability and recyclability. They possess the ability to be molded, and they can also strongly adhere on surfaces. Moreover, they exhibited oxygen and water vapor barrier comparable to low density polyethylene, while showing very low migration into food simulant, which position them as a promising material for flexible food and general packaging market. The vitrimers showed also the capability of biodegradation in seawater, providing a safe end of life in case of mismanagement.",

    "abstract": "Coupling between electromagnetic cavity fields and fluorescent molecules or quantum emitters can be strongly enhanced by reducing the cavity mode volume. Plasmonic structures allow light confinement down to volumes that are only a few cubic nanometers. At such length scales, nonlocal and quantum tunneling effects are expected to influence the emitter interaction with the surface plasmon modes, which unavoidably requires going beyond classical models to accurately describe the electron response at the metal surface. In this context, the quantum hydrodynamic theory (QHT) has emerged as an efficient tool to probe nonlocal and quantum effects in metallic nanostructures. Here, we apply state-of-the-art QHT to investigate the quantum effects on strong coupling of a dipole emitter placed at nanometer distances from metallic particles. A comparison with conventional local response approximation (LRA) and Thomas-Fermi hydrodynamic theory results shows the importance of quantum effects on the plasmon-emitter coupling. The QHT predicts qualitative deviation from LRA in the weak coupling regime that leads to quantitative differences in the strong coupling regime. In nano-gap systems, the inclusion of quantum broadening leads to the existence of an optimal gap size for Rabi splitting that minimizes the requirements on the emitter oscillator strength.",

    "abstract": "A comprehensive understanding of molecular changes during brain aging is essential to mitigate cognitive decline and delay neurodegenerative diseases. The interpretation of mRNA alterations during brain aging is influenced by the health and age of the animal cohorts studied. Here, we carefully consider these factors and provide an in-depth investigation of mRNA splicing and dynamics in the aging mouse brain, combining short- and long-read sequencing technologies with extensive bioinformatic analyses. Our findings encompass a spectrum of age-related changes, including differences in isoform usage, decreased mRNA dynamics and a module showing increased expression of neuronal genes. Notably, our results indicate a reduced abundance of mRNA isoforms leading to nonsense-mediated RNA decay and suggest a regulatory role for RNA-binding proteins, indicating that their regulation may be altered leading to the reshaping of the aged brain transcriptome. Collectively, our study highlights the importance of studying mRNA splicing events during brain aging.",

    "abstract": "Methylammonium lead iodide (MAPI) has proven to be an exceptional light-absorber for single-junction thin-film solar cells. Nonetheless, degradation induced by environmental agents (air, moisture, heat) limits the stability of this hybrid perovskite. Here, we demonstrate that coating evaporated MAPI thin films with different hydrophobic molecules leads to a significant improvement in their stability. We especially investigated the degradation of MAPI and the subsequent formation of PbI2 at 150 °C by in situ XRD analysis and showed that this transformation is remarkably slowed down in films coated with trioctyl phosphine oxide and tridodecyl methylammonium iodide. This enhances the processability of such films, which is an important aspect for the fabrication of thin-film devices. Eventually, we demonstrate that such protected films can be implemented in single-junction n-i-p solar cells without any loss in the device efficiency.",
