            "Rapid tumoritropic accumulation of systemically injected plateloid particles and their biodistribution. Nanoparticles for cancer therapy and imaging are designed to accumulate in the diseased tissue by exploiting the Enhanced Permeability and Retention (EPR) effect. This limits their size to about 100 nm. Here, using intravital microscopy and elemental analysis, we compare the in vivo localization of particles with different geometries and demonstrate that plateloid particles preferentially accumulate within the tumor vasculature at unprecedented levels, independent of the EPR effect. In melanoma-bearing mice, 1000 × 400 nm plateloid particles adhered to the tumor vasculature at about 5% and 10% of the injected dose per gram organ (ID/g) for untargeted and RGD-targeted particles respectively, and exhibited the highest tumor-to-liver accumulation ratios (0.22 and 0.35). Smaller and larger plateloid particles, as well as cylindroid particles, were more extensively sequestered by the liver, spleen, and lungs. Plateloid particles appeared well-suited for taking advantage of hydrodynamic forces and interfacial interactions required for efficient tumoritropic accumulation, even without using specific targeting ligands. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

            "A Rolled Organic Thermoelectric Generator with High Thermocouple Density. The surge in the number of distributed microelectronics and sensors requires versatile, scalable, and affordable power sources. Heat-harvesting organic thermoelectric generators (TEGs) are regarded as potential key components of the future energy landscape. Recent advances in the performance of organic thermoelectric materials have made practical applications of organic TEGs more feasible than ever before, yet the challenges of designing and fabricating organic TEGs suitable for real scenarios are scarcely addressed. Specifically, small sensors and wearables demand for micro-thermoelectric generators (µTEGs) with high power density architectures and small form factors, while typical demonstrations of organic TEGs are characterized by < 10 thermocouples (TCs) per cm2. This work presents a rolled, organic µTEG architecture combining large-area, solution-based deposition techniques, such as inkjet and spray-coating, and an ultrathin parylene substrate to achieve a thermocouple density of 1842 TCs cm−2. Such demonstrative µTEG reaches a thermoelectric conversion performance of 0.15 µW cm−2 at ΔT = 50 K. Such power output is well in line with finite element method simulations, which highlight the benefit of the architecture and show that remarkable power densities, in the mW cm−2 range at ΔT = 10 K, are realistically achievable with geometrical improvements and already ongoing advancements in organic thermoelectric inks.. 2024\n",

Two differently produced alumina coatings (by pulsed laser deposition (PLD) and detonation gun (DG)) and one alumina-forming coating realised by pack cementation are proposed as a protection barrier against corrosion of austenitic steels in Pb and PbBi. Samples were tested in oxygen-controlled stagnant Pb (10−7 wt.%) at 480 °C and 550 °C for up to 10,000 h and in turbulently flowing (up to 1.6 m/s) PbBi eutectic at 490 °C with 10−9–10−8 wt.% oxygen for about 500 h. All exposed coatings showed a good behaviour in flowing PbBi and in stagnant Pb at around 480 °C independent of the oxygen content. At 550 °C, the PLD coating failed most probably due to incomplete coating of the sample, while the DG sample protected the base material.. 2024\n",

We introduce and test a nonlocal energy-optimized model kernel (NEO) within the adiabatic connection fluctuation-dissipation (ACFD) density-functional theory for the jellium surface and uniform electron gas, as benchmarks for simple metallic systems. Our model kernel is short ranged for the uniform electron gas paradigm system and one-electron self-correlation free. One-electron self-interaction freedom is provided by an iso-orbital indicator. We show how several versions of the NEO kernel perform for the uniform electron gas and jellium surface energies, and in addition we explain the underlying physics of self-interaction-free exchange-only kernels for exponentially decaying surface densities.. 2016\n",

            "High-Open-Circuit-Voltage Solar Cells Based on Bright Mixed-Halide CsPbBrI2 Perovskite Nanocrystals Synthesized under Ambient Air Conditions. Lead halide perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) are currently emerging as one of the most interesting solution-processed semiconductors because they possess high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) and color tunability through anion exchange reactions or quantum confinement. Here, we show efficient solar cells based on mixed-halide (CsPbBrI2) NCs obtained via anion exchange reactions under ambient conditions. We performed anion exchange reactions in concentrated NC solutions with I-, thus inducing a PL red shift up to 676 nm and obtaining a high PLQY in film (65%). Solar cell devices operating in the wavelength range 350-660 nm were fabricated in air with two different deposition methods. The solar cells display a photoconversion efficiency of 5.3% and open circuit voltage (Voc) up to 1.31 V, among the highest reported for perovskite-based solar cells with band gap below 2 eV, clearly demonstrating the potential of this material.. 2018\n",
            "A new perspective on positive symptoms: expression of damage or self-defence mechanism of the brain?. Usually, positive neurological symptoms are considered as the consequence of a mere, afinalistic and abnormal increase in function of specific brain areas. However, according to the Theory of Active Inference, which argues that action and perception constitute a loop that updates expectations according to a Bayesian model, the brain is rather an explorer that formulates hypotheses and tests them to assess the correspondence between internal models and reality. Moreover, the cerebral cortex is characterised by a continuous “conflict” between different brain areas, which constantly attempt to expand in order to acquire more of the limited available computational resources, by means of their dopamine-induced neuroplasticity. Thus, it has recently been suggested that dreams, during rapid eye movement sleep (REMS), protect visual brain areas (deprived of their stimuli during rest) from being conquered by other normally stimulated ones. It is therefore conceivable that positive symptoms also have a functional importance for the brain. We evaluate supporting literature data of a ‘defensive’ role of positive symptoms and the relevance of dopamine-induced neuroplasticity in the context of neurodegenerative and psychiatric diseases. Furthermore, the possible functional significance of idiopathic REMS-related behavioural disorder as well as phantom limb syndrome is examined. We suggest that positive neurological symptoms are not merely a passive expression of a damage, but active efforts, related to dopamine-induced plasticity, to maintain a correct relationship between the external world and its brain representation, thus preventing healthy cortical areas from ousting injured ones.. 2024\n",

The optical properties of strongly doped semiconductor nanocrystals depend strongly on the carrier density of the nanocrystals. These characteristics can be exploited for the design of innovative optical devices based on ultrafast switching potentially in the THz modulation bandwidth. In this study, the optical response of one-dimensional photonic crystals incorporating colloidal nanoparticles of a highly doped semiconductor such as indium tin oxide (ITO) is investigated, taking into consideration the angular dependence of the photonic band gap and the position dependence of the photonic band gap on the light-induced tunability of the ITO doping.. 2024\n",
            "Mechanisms of alpha-synuclein action on neurotransmission: Cell-autonomous and non-cell autonomous role. Mutations and duplication/triplication of the alpha-synuclein (αSyn)-coding gene have been found to cause familial Parkinson’s disease (PD), while genetic polymorphisms in the region controlling the expression level and stability of αSyn have been identified as risk factors for idiopathic PD, pointing to the importance of wild-type (wt) αSyn dosage in the disease. Evidence that αSyn is present in the cerebrospinal fluid and interstitial brain tissue and that healthy neuronal grafts transplanted into PD patients often degenerate suggests that extracellularly-released αSyn plays a role in triggering the neurodegenerative process. αSyn’s role in neurotransmission has been shown in various cell culture models in which the protein was upregulated or deleted and in knock out and transgenic animal, with different results on αSyn’s effect on synaptic vesicle pool size and mobilization, αSyn being proposed as a negative or positive regulator of neurotransmitter release. In this review, we discuss the effect of αSyn on pre- and post-synaptic compartments in terms of synaptic vesicle trafficking, calcium entry and channel activity, and we focus on the process of exocytosis and internalization of αSyn and on the spreading of αSyn-driven effects due to the presence of the protein in the extracellular milieu.. 2015\n",

            "On the Synergistic Effects of Ligand-Mediated and Phage-Intrinsic Properties During In Vivo Selection. Phage display has been used as a powerful tool in the discovery and characterization of ligand-receptor complexes that can be utilized for therapeutic applications as well as to elucidate disease mechanisms. While the basic properties of phage itself have been well described, the behavior of phage in an in vivo setting is not as well understood due to the complexity of the system. Here, we take a dual approach in describing the biophysical mechanisms and properties that contribute to the efficacy of in vivo phage targeting. We begin by considering the interaction between phage and target by applying a kinetic model of ligand-receptor complexation and internalization. The multivalent display of peptides on the pIII capsid of phage is also discussed as an augmenting factor in the binding affinity of phage-displayed peptides to cellular targets accessible in a microenvironment of interest. Lastly, we examine the physical properties of the total phage particle that facilitate improved delivery and targeting in vivo compared to free peptides.© 2010, Elsevier Inc.. 2010\n",
            "Improving surface plasmon resonance imaging of DNA by creating new gold and silver based surface nanostructures. The use of nanoparticles (NPs) can substantially improve the analytical performance of surface plasmon resonance imaging (SPRi) in general, and in DNA sensing in particular. In this work, we report on the modification of the gold surface of commercial biochips with gold nanospheres, silica-coated gold nanoshells, and silver nanoprisms, respectively. The NPs were tethered onto the surface of the chip and functionalized with a DNA probe. The effects of tethering conditions and varying nanostructures on the SPRi signals were evaluated via hybridization assays. The results showed that coupling between planar surface plasmons and electric fields, generated by localized surface plasmons of the NPs, is mandatory for signal enhancement. Silver nanoprisms gave the best results in improving the signal change at a target DNA concentration of <50 nM by +50 % (compared to a conventional SPRi chip). The limit of detection for the target DNA was 0.5 nM which is 5 times less than in conventional SPRi. [Figure not available: see fulltext.] © 2013 Springer-Verlag Wien.. 2013\n",

Colloidal quantum dot (CQD) light-emitting diodes (LEDs) deliver a compelling performance in the visible, yet infrared CQD LEDs underperform their visible-emitting counterparts, largely due to their low photoluminescence quantum efficiency. Here we employ a ternary blend of CQD thin film that comprises a binary host matrix that serves to electronically passivate as well as to cater for an efficient and balanced carrier supply to the emitting quantum dot species. In doing so, we report infrared PbS CQD LEDs with an external quantum efficiency of ~7.9% and a power conversion efficiency of ~9.3%, thanks to their very low density of trap states, on the order of 1014 cm−3, and very high photoluminescence quantum efficiency in electrically conductive quantum dot solids of more than 60%. When these blend devices operate as solar cells they deliver an open circuit voltage that approaches their radiative limit thanks to the synergistic effect of the reduced trap-state density and the density of state modification in the nanocomposite.. 2019\n",
            "Dynamic distributed intrusion detection for secure Multi-Robot systems. A general technique to build a dynamic and distributed intrusion detector for a class of multi-agent systems is proposed in this paper, by which misbehavior in the motion of one or more agents can be discovered. Previous work from the authors has focused on how to distinguish the behavior of a misbehaving agent in a completely distributed way, by developing a solution where agents act as local monitors of their neighbors and use locally sensed information as well as data received from other monitors at a particular time. In this work, we improve the system detection capability by allowing monitors to use information collected at different instants and thus realizing a dynamic state observer that is valid for any system in the considered class. Finally, we show through simulations the effectiveness of the proposed solution for a case study. ©2009 IEEE.. 2009\n",

Internal consistency of local depth, slant, and curvature judgments was studied by asking participants to match two 3D surfaces rendered by different mixtures of 3D cues (velocity, texture, and shading). We found that perceptual judgments were not consistent with each other, with cue-specific distortions. Adding multiple cues did not eliminate the inconsistencies of the judgments. These results can be predicted by the Intrinsic Constraint (IC) model according to which the perceptual metric local estimates are a monotonically increasing function of the Signal-to-Noise Ratio of the optimal combination of direct information of 3D shape (Domini, Caudek, & Tassinari, 2006). © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.. 2010\n",
            "Shaping nano-/micro-particles for enhanced vascular interaction in laminar flows. Non-spherical nano-/micro-particles can drift laterally (hydrodynamic margination) in a linear laminar flow under the concurrent effect of hydrodynamic and inertial forces. Such a feature can be exploited in the rational design of particle-based intravascular and pulmonary delivery systems and for designing new flow fractioning systems for high-throughput particle separation. A general approach is presented to predict the marginating behavior of non-spherical particles. The lateral drift velocity is shown to depend on the particle Stokes number Sta and to grow with the size, density and rotational inertia of the particle. Elongated particles, in particular, low aspect ratio discoidal particles, exhibit the largest propensity to marginate in a linear laminar flow. In the blood microcirculation, at low shear rates (S<100s-1), non-spherical particles oscillate around their trajectory and margination can only be achieved through the application of external force fields (gravitational, magnetic); whereas for larger S (100s -1<S<104s-1), micrometer particles can achieve drift velocities in the order of 1-10νms-1. In the pulmonary circulation, hydrodynamic margination can be observed even for sub-micrometer particles. Finally, the inherent propensity of non-spherical particles to drift laterally can be effectively exploited for designing microfluidic devices, based on the flow fractioning approach, for particle separation without using external lateral force fields. © 2009 IOP Publishing Ltd.. 2009\n",

            "Effects of subacute toluene exposure on protein phosphorylation levels in rat frontoparietal and striatal membranes. Effects of subacute toluene exposure (80 p.p.m. toluene in air, 5 + 4 days, 6 h day‐1) were analysed on calcium (Ca2+)‐ and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)‐induced protein phosphorylation levels in membrane preparations from the frontoparietal cortex and the striatum of the adult male rat. After protein separation by gel electrophoresis, the amount of radioactive phosphate incorporated from adenosine 5′‐[γ‐32P] triphosphate, tetra‐(ethylammonium) salt ([32P]ATP) was measured indirectly by auto‐radiography. The 21 most phosphorylated protein bands were then analysed by computerized image analysis. In the frontoparietal cortex no protein bands were significantly affected after cAMP‐induced back phosphorylation, while after Ca2+ stimulation there was a decreased incorporation of [32P]ATP in a 22,000 protein band. In the striatum there was a reduced incorporation of [32P]ATP in a 26,000 protein band after cAMP‐induced back phosphorylation, and in four bands of 20,000, 21,000, 52,000 and 134,000, respectively, after Ca2+ stimulation. The reduced incorporation of [32P]ATP in these proteins indicated increased original phosphorylation levels after toluene exposure. A comparison between the frontoparietal cortex and the striatum showed a selective vulnerability of phosphorylation processes in striatal membrane protein bands. In conclusion, toluene exposure at low doses augments membrane protein phosphorylation levels in the rat forebrain and especially in the striatum, probably leading to changes in information handling and/or metabolic changes. © 1987 Scandinavian Physiological Society. 1987\n",
            "Effects of sustained hyperprolactinemia inducedby chronic treatment with domperidone on central dopaminergic systems in the rat. Chronic treatment with Domperidone (DOM) had no effect on basal prolactin (PRL) secretion or basal levels of Dopamine (DA) metabolites in basal hypothalamus and striatum as compared with the vehicle treated rats. Animals chronically treated with DOM did not present tolerance to a challenge dose of Haloperidol (HAL) and DOM either measuring PRL secretion or striatal DA metabolite levels. The PRL-induced incrase in hypothalamic 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) was reduced. These results were accompained by no change at striatal DA receptors, a slight reduction in density-affinity at hypothalamic DA receptors but clear-cut modification in pituitary DA receptors with the appearance of a high affinity-low capacity binding sites. It can be surmised that sustained hyperprolactinemia may induce tolerance in hypothalamic Tuberoinfundibular (TIDA) neurons involved in the inhibitory control of PRL secretion and a change in the kinetic properties of pituitary DA receptors, but it does not consistently affect the activity of the nigro-striatal DA system. © 1986 The Italian Pharmacological Society.. 1986\n",

This comprehensive Review delves into the chemical principles governing RNA-mediated crowding events, commonly referred to as granules or biological condensates. We explore the pivotal role played by RNA sequence, structure, and chemical modifications in these processes, uncovering their correlation with crowding phenomena under physiological conditions. Additionally, we investigate instances where crowding deviates from its intended function, leading to pathological consequences. By deepening our understanding of the delicate balance that governs molecular crowding driven by RNA and its implications for cellular homeostasis, we aim to shed light on this intriguing area of research. Our exploration extends to the methodologies employed to decipher the composition and structural intricacies of RNA granules, offering a comprehensive overview of the techniques used to characterize them, including relevant computational approaches. Through two detailed examples highlighting the significance of noncoding RNAs, NEAT1 and XIST, in the formation of phase-separated assemblies and their influence on the cellular landscape, we emphasize their crucial role in cellular organization and function.

High-temperature X-ray diffraction experiments have been performed on melilite solid solutions, on single crystal and powder samples. In åkermanite-gehlenite series, the volumetric thermal expansion increases from gehlenite, 26.5(2) E-06 K-1, to åkermanite, 31.2(1) E-06 K-1.

            "Why only solubility parameters? Liquid-phase exfoliation from the point of view of colloidal chemistry. Liquid-phase exfoliation has been widely used to obtain 2D nanomaterials from layered or non-layered solids. Most reports have focused on exfoliation procedures using aqueous solutions of passivating agents, functionalized materials in water, or pristine materials in 'good' organic solvents. Herein, we highlight the third method applied to carbon nanomaterials because it results in stable and concentrated systems without any other additives, and the deposited materials form conductive patterns after solvent drying without the need for post-treatments like (electro)chemical reduction or removal of passivating agents. Good solvents for exfoliating pristine materials have been ascribed as having the 'correct' match of Hansen solubility parameters. Although this approach successfully enhances the yield in terms of mass concentration, it does not explain the high stability of dispersions prepared in liquids ascribed as 'bad' solvents or some properties observed for exfoliated materials in both 'good' and 'bad' ones, like sedimentation. In this review, we have reinterpreted organic dispersions of pristine carbon materials using concepts of Colloidal Chemistry, which can explain many poorly understood properties and guide new improvements in this area.. 2024\n",

All-optical reversible actuation of photochromic-polymer microsystems and a fully wavelength-controllable photoactuator were analyzed. The substrate consisted of the polymer poly(ethyl methacrylate-co-methyl acrylate) (PEMMA) with a glass-transition temperature (Tg) of 48 °C and doped with 5.0 wt.-% photochromic molecules. The reduction of the merocyanine (MC) partial molar volume resulted into an increase of the effective free volume in the polymer matrix, giving rise to a decrease of its effective Tg. It was shown that a reduced Tg, together with the temperature rise during the laser pulse, favor a decrease in the viscosity of the sample.. 2005\n",

            "Stabilization of discrete time-crystalline response on a superconducting quantum computer by increasing the interaction range. The simulation of complex quantum many-body systems is a promising short-term goal of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. However, the limited connectivity of native qubits hinders the implementation of quantum algorithms that require long-range interactions. We present the outcomes of a digital quantum simulation where we overcome the limitations of the qubit connectivity in NISQ devices. Utilizing the universality of quantum processor native gates, we demonstrate how to implement couplings among physically disconnected qubits at the cost of increasing the circuit depth. We apply this method to simulate a Floquet-driven quantum spin chain featuring interactions beyond nearest neighbors. Specifically, we benchmark the prethermal stabilization of the discrete Floquet time-crystalline response as the interaction range increases, a phenomenon never observed experimentally. Our quantum simulation addresses one of the significant limitations of superconducting quantum processors, namely, device connectivity. It reveals that nontrivial physics involving couplings beyond nearest neighbors can be extracted after the impact of noise is properly taken into account in the theoretical model and consequently mitigated from the experimental data.. 2024\n",

            "Dominance of Metric Correlations in Two-Dimensional Neuronal Cultures Described through a Random Field Ising Model. We introduce a novel random field Ising model, grounded on experimental observations, to assess the importance of metric correlations in cortical circuits in vitro. Metric correlations arise from both the finite axonal length and the heterogeneity in the spatial arrangement of neurons. The experiments consider the response of neuronal cultures to an external electric stimulation for a gradually weaker connectivity strength between neurons, and in cultures with different spatial configurations. The model can be analytically solved in the metric-free, mean-field scenario. The presence of metric correlations precipitates a strong deviation from the mean field. Null models of the same networks that preserve the distribution of connections recover the mean field. Our results show that metric-inherited correlations in spatial networks dominate the connectivity blueprint, mask the actual distribution of connections, and may emerge as the asset that shapes network dynamics.. 2017\n",

The influence of nanocrystallinity on the electronic and mechanical properties of metal nanoparticles is still poorly understood, due to the difficulty in synthesizing nanoparticles with a controlled internal structure. Here, we report on a new method for the selective synthesis of Au nanoparticles in either a single-domain or a polycrystalline phase maintaining the same chemical environment. We obtain quasi-spherical nanoparticles whose diameter is tunable from 6 to 13 nm with a resolution down to ≈0.5 nm and narrow size distribution (4-5%).

            "Sex dimorphism controls dysbindin-related cognitive dysfunctions in mice and humans with the contribution of COMT. Cognitive dysfunctions are core-enduring symptoms of schizophrenia, with important sex-related differences. Genetic variants of the DTBPN1 gene associated with reduced dysbindin-1 protein (Dys) expression negatively impact cognitive functions in schizophrenia through a functional epistatic interaction with Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT). Dys is involved in the trafficking of dopaminergic receptors, crucial for prefrontal cortex (PFC) signaling regulation. Moreover, dopamine signaling is modulated by estrogens via inhibition of COMT expression. We hypothesized a sex dimorphism in Dys-related cognitive functions dependent on COMT and estrogen levels. Our multidisciplinary approach combined behavioral-molecular findings on genetically modified mice, human postmortem Dys expression data, and in vivo fMRI during a working memory task performance. We found cognitive impairments in male mice related to genetic variants characterized by reduced Dys protein expression (pBonferroni = 0.0001), as well as in male humans through a COMT/Dys functional epistatic interaction involving PFC brain activity during working memory (t(23) = −3.21; pFDR = 0.004). Dorsolateral PFC activity was associated with lower working memory performance in males only (p = 0.04). Also, male humans showed decreased Dys expression in dorsolateral PFC during adulthood (pFDR = 0.05). Female Dys mice showed preserved cognitive performances with deficits only with a lack of estrogen tested in an ovariectomy model (pBonferroni = 0.0001), suggesting that genetic variants reducing Dys protein expression could probably become functional in females when the protective effect of estrogens is attenuated, i.e., during menopause. Overall, our results show the differential impact of functional variants of the DTBPN1 gene interacting with COMT on cognitive functions across sexes in mice and humans, underlying the importance of considering sex as a target for patient stratification and precision medicine in schizophrenia.. 2024\n",

The comparison of the three systems shows that ablation with nanosecond (30 ns) pulses results in significant modifications of the photosensitive halonaphthalene dopants, including an increase in their photolysis yields and the formation of additional products.

            "Numerical study of transient absorption saturation in single-layer graphene for optical nanoscopy applications. Transient absorption, or pump–probe microscopy is an absorption-based technique that can explore samples ultrafast dynamic properties and provide fluorescence-free contrast mechanisms. When applied to graphene and its derivatives, this technique exploits the graphene transient response caused by the ultrafast interband transition as the imaging contrast mechanism. The saturation of this transition is fundamental to allow for super-resolution optical far-field imaging, following the reversible saturable optical fluorescence transitions (RESOLFT) concept, although not involving fluorescence. With this aim, we propose a model to numerically compute the temporal evolution under saturation conditions of the single-layer graphene molecular states, which are involved in the transient absorption. Exploiting an algorithm based on the fourth order Runge–Kutta (RK4) method, and the density matrix approach, we numerically demonstrate that the transient absorption signal of single-layer graphene varies linearly as a function of excitation intensity until it reaches saturation. We experimentally verify this model using a custom pump–probe super-resolution microscope. The results define the intensities necessary to achieve super-resolution in a pump–probe nanoscope while studying graphene-based materials and open the possibility of predicting such a saturation process in other light-matter interactions that undergo the same transition.. 2024\n",

            "Gas-Solid Chemisorption/Adsorption and Mechanochemical Selectivity in Dynamic Nonporous Hybrid Metal Organic Materials. Gas-solid chemisorption of HCl and adsorption of MeOH/EtOH by nonporous chiral copper(II) coordination complexes 1·MeOH and 1·MeOH occur in a cooperative and dynamic manner to give solvated second sphere adducts 1′·MeOH/EtOH. The chemisorption process involves dramatic atomic rearrangements in the crystalline state upon cleavage and formation of H-Cl, N-H, Cu-N, and Cu-Cl coordination and covalent bonds from the gas and solid state, respectively. Using mechanochemistry, the chloride-bridged coordination complex 1·MeOH is selectively produced by means of a dehydrochlorination reaction, but not in solution in which a mixture of 1·MeOH and 1·MeOH is obtained. 1·MeOH also via chemisorption and adsorption can trap HCl and MeOH to give the second sphere adduct 1′·MeOH. The adsorption process is confirmed by forming the second sphere adduct 1′·EtOH by exposing both 1·MeOH and 1·MeOH to HCl and ethanol. Quantum-mechanical (QM) calculations specific for solid phases give insights into the relative stabilities of the hybrid metal organic materials involved in the mechanochemical reaction producing selectively 1·MeOH, giving a good agreement with the experimental results.. 2017\n",
            "A robot-based assessment of trunk control in Spinal Cord Injured athletes. Spinal Cord Injury (SCI) affects trunk control and determines altered or absent neuromuscular activity and sensory feedback below the lesioned spinal segment. The practice of sport or of any physical activity are key elements for improving the health and quality of life of people with SCI. Paralympic athletes overcome limits related to their injuries, achieving high neuromuscular control and coordination. Among the sports that have been adapted for people with disabilities, sit-skiing is a sport that requires good trunk control. However, there is a lack of instruments and protocols for its quantitative assessment. In this work we describe a robot-based protocol designed to assess trunk control and tested with two expert sit-skiers and eight unimpaired subjects. We used the robotic platform hunova® to evaluate both the active and the reactive component of trunk control through two different exercises. We investigated the strategy adopted by subjects to perform these exercises and the changes due to their repetition. All unimpaired subjects successfully completed the proposed protocol. The repetition of both exercises induced a learning process leading to differences in motor performance. Similar results could be observed also in the two athletes, whose performance was characterized by differences due to the severity of their lesion and their skiing skills.. 2020\n",
            "See Elegans: Simple-to-use, accurate, and automatic 3D detection of neural activity from densely packed neurons. In the emerging field of whole-brain imaging at single-cell resolution, which represents one of the new frontiers to investigate the link between brain activity and behavior, the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans offers one of the most characterized models for systems neuroscience. Whole-brain recordings consist of 3D time series of volumes that need to be processed to obtain neuronal traces. Current solutions for this task are either computationally demanding or limited to specific acquisition setups. Here, we propose See Elegans, a direct programming algorithm that combines different techniques for automatic neuron segmentation and tracking without the need for the RFP channel, and we compare it with other available algorithms. While outperforming them in most cases, our solution offers a novel method to guide the identification of a subset of head neurons based on position and activity. The built-in interface allows the user to follow and manually curate each of the processing steps. See Elegans is thus a simple-to-use interface aimed at speeding up the post-processing of volumetric calcium imaging recordings while maintaining a high level of accuracy and low computational demands.. 2024\n",

The photochemical modifications induced in the UV ablation of molecular substrates are examined in model systems of polymer films (PMMA) doped with a highly photosensitive organic pigment (1-iodonaphthalene). Ablation by nanosecond laser pulses at 248 nm is shown to result in an increase of photolysis yields and in the efficient formation of new products. In sharp contrast, photoproduct formation in the corresponding ablation with 500 fs pulses is well defined and limited. Thus, besides its well-acknowledged thermal advantage, fs ablation is shown to provide a high degree of control over the induced photochemical modifications. The results of the study are correlated with the specific procedures that have been defined for the efficient restoration of painted surfaces with minimal photochemical modification to the substrate.. 1999\n",
            "Role of Trapped Carriers Dynamics in Operating Lead Halide Wide-Bandgap Perovskite Solar Cells. Here we investigate the role of charge trapping/recombination dynamics at halide interstitials, responsible for halide segregation, when wide-band gap perovskites are embodied in solar cells. Such dynamics can be either fast (picoseconds-nanoseconds) or slow (nanoseconds-μs) according to the oxidation state of the halide defect. When carriers accumulate within the perovskite, at open-circuit conditions, the trapping/recombination process having the slowest dynamics causes photo instability predominantly. When the solar cell is under a load, the device performances are mainly affected by the fast carrier trapping, depending on a direct competition between the trapping rate and the charge extraction efficiency. We show that by selectively passivating the defects correlated to fast carrier trappings, the solar cell operation and stability can be largely improved by improving the charge extraction. Thus, a deep knowledge of the chemical nature of defect activities and the corresponding electronic dynamics is crucial for maximizing the performance and stability of wide bandgap perovskite solar cells.. 2024\n",
            "UV laser ablation of halonaphthalene-doped PMMA: Chemical modifications above versus below the ablation threshold. Laser-induced fluorescence is employed to monitor the photochemical modifications that bromo- and iodonaphthalene incorporated in PMMA films undergo following ablation at 248 nm. Following irradiation at low fluences with nanosecond pulses, photolysis of the dopants is found to result in the formation of naphthalene-like photoproducts, whereas above the threshold additional products are observed. Based on concentration studies, these are tentatively ascribed to species containing two naphthyl groups. In close correspondence to the formation of the new species, the photolysis yields for both dopants are found to increase sharply above the threshold. Finally, the nature and extent of these photochemical effects is indicated to depend sensitively on the laser pulse width.

Phengite samples (2M1 and 3T politypes) and a synthetic end-member muscovite specimen were studied by in situ high-temperature synchrotron radiation X-ray diffraction. The measured volume thermal expansion of 2M1 phengite (<αV> ≈ 36.6 × 10-6 K-1) was systematically greater than <αV> of the 3T polytype (≈33.3 × 10-6 K-1). A positive linear correlation between the average thermal expansion on (001) plane and the mean tetrahedral rotation angle at ambient condition is proposed on the ground of new measurements and literature data. Dehydroxylation processes were observed in 2M1, starting at 1,000 K in 3T at 800 and 945 K in synthetic muscovite. Rietveld refinements allowed a determination of structural variations upon heating of phengite samples and their dehydroxylate phases. The phengite structure expands by regularizing the tetrahedral sheet and by reducing the bond length differences between the outer and inner coordination shell of the interlayer site. The dehydroxylate phase derived from 2M1 is characterized by fivefold polyhedra in the low temperature form as a consequence of two OH groups reacting to form H2O + O (residual). The dehydroxylate exhibits an increase of the cation-cation distances along the M-Or-M bonds with respect to low-temperature phengite structures. For the 3T phase, we were unable to achieve completion of dehydroxylation. The refined structural model of the dehydroxylate phase shows two hydroxyl sites, but at a short distance from one another. This result suggests that the dehydroxylation reaction did not proceed to completion. © Springer-Verlag 2008.. 2008\n",
            "Prediction of protein-RNA interactions from single-cell transcriptomic data. Proteins are crucial in regulating every aspect of RNA life, yet understanding their interactions with coding and noncoding RNAs remains limited. Experimental studies are typically restricted to a small number of cell lines and a limited set of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). Although computational methods based on physico-chemical principles can predict protein-RNA interactions accurately, they often lack the ability to consider cell-type-specific gene expression and the broader context of gene regulatory networks (GRNs). Here, we assess the performance of several GRN inference algorithms in predicting protein-RNA interactions from single-cell transcriptomic data, and propose a pipeline, called scRAPID (single-cell transcriptomic-based RnA Protein Interaction Detection), that integrates these methods with the catRAPID algorithm, which can identify direct physical interactions between RBPs and RNA molecules. Our approach demonstrates that RBP-RNA interactions can be predicted from single-cell transcriptomic data, with performances comparable or superior to those achieved for the well-established task of inferring transcription factor-target interactions. The incorporation of catRAPID significantly enhances the accuracy of identifying interactions, particularly with long noncoding RNAs, and enables the identification of hub RBPs and RNAs. Additionally, we show that interactions between RBPs can be detected based on their inferred RNA targets. The software is freely available at https://github.com/tartaglialabIIT/scRAPID.. 2024\n",

In this work, carbon nanofibers were used as doping material to develop a highly conductive chitosan-based composite. Scaffolds based on chitosan only and chitosan/carbon composites were prepared by precipitation. Carbon nanofibers were homogeneously dispersed throughout the chitosan matrix, and the composite scaffold was highly porous with fully interconnected pores. Chitosan/carbon scaffolds had an elastic modulus of 28.1 ± 3.3 KPa, similar to that measured for rat myocardium, and excellent electrical properties, with a conductivity of 0.25 ± 0.09 S/m. The scaffolds were seeded with neonatal rat heart cells and cultured for up to 14 days, without electrical stimulation. After 14 days of culture, the scaffold pores throughout the construct volume were filled with cells. The metabolic activity of cells in chitosan/carbon constructs was significantly higher as compared to cells in chitosan scaffolds. The incorporation of carbon nanofibers also led to increased expression of cardiac-specific genes involved in muscle contraction and electrical coupling. This study demonstrates that the incorporation of carbon nanofibers into porous chitosan scaffolds improved the properties of cardiac tissue constructs, presumably through enhanced transmission of electrical signals between the cells. © 2014 American Chemical Society.. 2014\n",

            "Combination of enzymes and flow perfusion conditions improves osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow stromal cells cultured upon starch/poly(ε- caprolactone) fiber meshes. Previous studies have shown that α-amylase and lipase are capable of enhancing the degradation of fiber meshes blends of starch and poly(ε-caprolactone) (SPCL) under dynamic conditions, and consequently to promote the proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow stromal cells (MSCs). This study investigated the effect of flow perfusion bioreactor culture in combination with enzymes on the osteogenic differentiation of MSCs. SPCL fiber meshes were seeded with MSCs and cultured with osteogenic medium supplemented with α-amylase, lipase, or a combination of the two for 8 or 16 days using static or flow conditions. Lipase and its combination with α-amylase enhanced cell proliferation after 16 days. In addition, the flow perfusion culture enhanced the infiltration of cells and facilitated greater distribution of extracellular matrix (ECM) throughout the scaffolds in the presence/absence of enzymes. A significant amount of calcium was detected after 16 days in all groups cultured in flow conditions compared with static cultures. Nevertheless, when α-amylase and lipase were included in the flow perfusion cultures, the calcium content was 379 ± 30 μg/scaffold after as few as 8 days. The highest calcium content (1271 ± 32 μg/scaffold) was obtained for SPCL/cell constructs cultured for 16 days in the presence of lipase and flow. Furthermore, von Kossa staining and tetracycline fluorescence of histological sections demonstrated mineral deposition within the scaffolds for all groups cultured for 16 days under flow. However, all the data corroborate that lipase coupled with flow perfusion conditions improve the osteogenic differentiation of MSCs and enhance ECM mineralization. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.. 2010\n",
            "CD99 inhibits neural differentiation of human Ewing sarcoma cells and thereby contributes to oncogenesis. Ewing sarcoma (EWS) is an aggressive bone tumor of uncertain cellular origin. CD99 is a membrane protein that is expressed in most cases of EWS, although its function in the disease is unknown. Here we have shown that endogenous CD99 expression modulates EWS tumor differentiation and malignancy. We determined that knocking down CD99 expression in human EWS cell lines reduced their ability to form tumors and bone metastases when xenografted into immunodeficient mice and diminished their tumorigenic characteristics in vitro. Further, reduction of CD99 expression resulted in neurite outgrowth and increased expression of β-III tubulin and markers of neural differentiation. Analysis of a panel of human EWS cells revealed an inverse correlation between CD99 and H-neurofilament expression, as well as an inverse correlation between neural differentiation and oncogenic transformation. As knockdown of CD99 also led to an increase in phosphorylation of ERK1/2, we suggest that the CD99-mediated prevention of neural differentiation of EWS occurs through MAPK pathway modulation. Together, these data indicate a new role for CD99 in preventing neural differentiation of EWS cells and suggest that blockade of CD99 or its downstream molecular pathway may be a new therapeutic approach for EWS.. 2010\n",
            "Overcoming barriers in Pseudomonas aeruginosa lung infections: Engineered nanoparticles for local delivery of a cationic antimicrobial peptide. Cationic antimicrobial peptides (CAMPs) are very promising in the treatment of multi-drug resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa lung infections experienced by cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. Nevertheless, there is an urgent need of inhalable formulations able to deliver the intact CAMP in conductive airways and to shield its interactions with airway mucus/bacterial biofilm, thus enhancing CAMP/bacteria interactions. Along these lines, the aim of this work was the design and development of nano-embedded microparticles (NEM) for sustained delivery of CAMPs in the lung. To this purpose, nanoparticles (NPs) made of poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) containing a model CAMP, colistin (Col), were produced by emulsion/solvent diffusion technique. Engineering NPs with chitosan (CS) and poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) allowed to modulate surface properties and, in so doing, to improve NP transport through artificial CF mucus. In order to achieve a long-term stable dosage form useful for NP inhalation, NPs were spray-dried in different carriers (lactose or mannitol), thus producing NEM. The most promising NEM formulations were selected on the basis of bulk and flow properties, distribution of NPs in the carrier and aerosolization performance upon delivery through a breath-actuated dry powder inhaler. Of note, selected Col-loaded NEM were found to kill P. aeruginosa biofilm and to display a prolonged efficacy in biofilm eradication compared to the free Col. This effect was likely ascribable to the ability of NPs to penetrate into bacterial biofilm, as demonstrated by confocal analysis, and to sustain Col release inside it. Taken all together, our results indicate that adequate engineering of PLGA NPs represents an enticing technological approach to harness novel antimicrobials for P. aeruginosa lung infection, such as CAMPs, especially in CF.. 2015\n",
            "Charge Localization, Stabilization, and Hopping in Lead Halide Perovskites: Competition between Polaron Stabilization and Cation Disorder. Metal halide perovskites, of general formula ABX3, show a complex interplay of the inorganic BX3 sublattice and the organic/inorganic A-site cations, which likely determines some of their peculiar optoelectronic properties. Comprehension of the physics underlying this interaction may reveal further means of fine-tuning their optoelectronic response. Here, we investigate in depth charge-lattice interactions associated with the formation of polarons in different models of the prototypical CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite through advanced electronic structure calculations. We demonstrate that charge localization, while induced by the disordered dipolar field of the organic cations, is stabilized by distortions in the inorganic sublattice. Polaron hopping between neighboring minima is related to the random reorientation of the organic cations and occurs via a delocalized transition state. Our simulations highlight a struggle between thermally induced disorder, driven by the motion of A-site cations, and polaron stabilization within the BX3 sublattice, which explains the simultaneous low mobility and high diffusion length of charge carriers in lead halide perovskites.. 2019\n",
            "Prelamin A is involved in early steps of muscle differentiation. Lamin A is a nuclear lamina constituent implicated in a number of human disorders including Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy. Since increasing evidence suggests a role of the lamin A precursor in nuclear functions, we investigated the processing of prelamin A during differentiation of C2C12 mouse myoblasts. We show that both protein levels and cellular localization of prelamin A are modulated during myoblast activation. Similar changes of lamin A-binding proteins emerin and LAP2α were observed. Furthermore, prelamin A was found in a complex with LAP2α in differentiating myoblasts. Prelamin A accumulation in cycling myoblasts by expressing unprocessable mutants affected LAP2α and PCNA amount and increased caveolin 3 mRNA and protein levels, while accumulation of prelamin A in differentiated muscle cells following treatment with a farnesyl transferase inhibitor appeared to inhibit caveolin 3 expression. Our data provide evidence for a critical role of the lamin A precursor in the early steps of muscle cell differentiation. © 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.. 2008\n",

            "The mutant p53-ID4 complex controls VEGFA isoforms by recruiting lncRNA MALAT1. The abundant, nuclear-retained, metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (MALAT1) has been associated with a poorly differentiated and aggressive phenotype of mammary carcinomas. This long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) localizes to nuclear speckles, where it interacts with a subset of splicing factors and modulates their activity. In this study, we demonstrate that oncogenic splicing factor SRSF1 bridges MALAT1 to mutant p53 and ID4 proteins in breast cancer cells. Mutant p53 and ID4 delocalize MALAT1 from nuclear speckles and favor its association with chromatin. This enables aberrant recruitment of MALAT1 on VEGFA pre-mRNA and modulation of VEGFA isoforms expression. Interestingly, VEGFA-dependent expression signatures associate with ID4 expression specifically in basal-like breast cancers carrying TP53 mutations. Our results highlight a key role for MALAT1 in control of VEGFA isoforms expression in breast cancer cells expressing gain-of-function mutant p53 and ID4 proteins.. 2017\n",

This paper reports on the investigation of the electronic properties of a thin film CdS/CdTe solar cell with the Ion Beam Induced Charge (IBIC) technique. The device under test is a thin film (total thickness around 10 μm) multilayer heterojunction solar cell, displaying an efficiency of 14% under AM1.5 illumination conditions. The IBIC measurements were carried out using focused 3.150 MeV He ions raster scanned onto the surface of the back electrode. The charge collection efficiency (CCE) maps show inhomogeneous response of the cell to be attributed to the polycrystalline nature of the CdTe bulk material. Finally, the evolution of the IBIC signal versus the ion fluence was studied in order to evaluate the radiation hardness of the CdS/CdTe solar cells in a view of their use in solar modules for space applications. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

            "Assessment of the Monitor System Interface: A Setup System Tool for Industrial Exoskeletons. Workers in industries are prone to injuries and musculoskeletal disorders when performing normal tasks. A potential solution to alleviate this situation is the use of back-support industrial exoskeletons in the workplace. These wearable devices consist of electrical actuators, sensors, and controllers that produce appropriate assistive forces when workers complete their activities. The technological integration of different active components in the exoskeleton creates a complex system with multiple strategies to achieve the force modulation produced by the system. In these scenarios, it is important to open some domains of the exoskeleton to the user to initialize the system, calibrate the exoskeleton, introduce user personal information (such as weight and height), and modify the controller parameters. The work presented in this study shows the assessment of the monitor system interface, which is a graphical user interface that allows the user to interact directly with the exoskeleton domains with easy adjustments. XoTrunk is an active industrial exoskeleton designed for carrying and lifting tasks. The controller architecture permits adequate force modulation according to the user action with an adjustable control strategy from the monitor system interface. Experiments were conducted with 12 participants in a standard lifting action wearing the exoskeleton. The results showed that the monitor system interface is a useful tool for human-robot interaction. The current version of the interface grants the user access to the exoskeleton domains previously mentioned.. 2023\n",

            "Mycelium Agrowaste-Bound Biocomposites as Thermal and Acoustic Insulation Materials in Building Construction. The predominant use of synthetic materials, such as fiberglass and polymeric foams, for thermal and acoustic insulation in the construction sector contributes to the recalcitrant waste accumulation in the environment and is not economically sustainable in the long term. This is because they are developed with linear economy standards, they are neither reusable nor recyclable, and, at their end of lifecycle, they are not compostable, with a great amount of them finishing in landfills. This work is focused on the development of natural, self-growing mycelium-biocomposites as sustainable alternatives to these conventional synthetic materials. Specifically, fungal mycelium derived from the nonpathogenic fungal strain Pleurotus ostreatus is fed by coffee silverskin flakes, a lignocellulosic agrowaste from roasted coffee seeds, forming 3D biocomposites. The physicochemical properties of the obtained composite are thoroughly investigated, with a final focus on their thermal and acoustic insulation properties. As proved, the natural agrowaste-mycelium composites possess high porosity and thus low density, good thermal properties, and satisfactory sound absorption capability. Such properties combined with the minimal energetic requirements for their growth and their fully compostable end-of-life nature make them valuable alternatives for thermal and acoustic insulation in building construction, among other applications, promoting environmental and economic sustainability.. 2024\n",

            "Motor or non-motor speech interference? A multimodal fMRI and direct cortical stimulation mapping study. We retrospectively analyzed data from 15 patients, with a normal pre-operative cognitive performance, undergoing awake surgery for left fronto-temporal low-grade glioma. We combined a pre-surgical measure (fMRI maps of motor- and language-related centers) with intra-surgical measures (MNI-registered cortical sites data obtained during intra-operative direct electrical stimulation, DES, while they performed the two most common language tasks: number counting and picture naming). Selective DES effects along the precentral gyrus/inferior frontal gyrus (and/or the connected speech articulation network) were obtained. DES of the precentral gyrus evoked the motor speech arrest, i.e., anarthria (with apparent mentalis muscle movements). We calculated the number of shared voxels between the lip-tongue and overt counting related- and silent naming-related fMRI maps and the Volumes of Interest (VOIs) obtained by merging together the MNI sites at which a given speech disturbance was observed, normalized on their mean the values (i.e., Z score). Both tongue- and lips-related movements fMRI maps maximally overlapped (Z = 1.05 and Z = 0.94 for lips and tongue vs. 0.16 and −1.003 for counting and naming) with the motor speech arrest seed. DES of the inferior frontal gyrus, pars opercularis and the rolandic operculum induced speech arrest proper (without apparent mentalis muscle movements). This area maximally overlapped with overt counting-related fMRI map (Z = −0.11 and Z = 0.09 for lips and tongue vs. 0.9 and 0.0006 for counting and naming). Interestingly, our fMRI maps indicated reduced Broca's area activity during silent speech compared to overt speech. Lastly, DES of the inferior frontal gyrus, pars opercularis and triangularis evoked variations of the output, i.e., dysarthria, a motor speech disorder occurring when patients cannot control the muscles used to produce articulated sounds (phonemes). Silent object naming-related fMRI map maximally overlapped (Z = −0.93 and Z = −1.04 for lips and tongue vs. −1.07 and 0.99 for counting and naming) with this seed. Speech disturbances evoked by DES may be thought of as selective interferences with specific recruitment of left inferior frontal gyrus and precentral cortex which are differentiable in terms of the specific interference induced.. 2024\n",

            "\"ion sliding\" on graphene: A novel concept to boost supercapacitor performance. Efficient ionic transport in nanoporous carbon electrodes is pivotal for the development of high-rate electrochemical capacitive energy storage in supercapacitors (SCs). Over the past decade, the understanding of the charging/discharging mechanisms in nanostructured carbon electrodes and the elucidation of confinement and desolvation of ions in electrically charged carbon nanopores have spurred the development of advanced SCs holding ever-increasing energy density. Crucially, these advancements have to be accomplished without sacrificing the extraordinary power handling and cycling lifetime of the SC. In this work, we investigated the interaction between single-/few-layer graphene (SLG/FLG) flakes or activated carbon (AC) films and 1 M tetraethylammonium tetrafluoroborate (TEABF4) in propylene carbonate (PC) by lateral force microscopy (LFM) measurements. We unravel that the electrolyte nanotribology on SLG/FLG flakes incorporated into AC-based electrodes is effective at boosting the power performance of commercial-like SCs (active material mass loading ∼10 mg cm-2), thus maximizing the advantage of using nanoporous nanocarbon electrodes with high energy density. At a charge/discharge (CD) current density of 0.1 A g-1, our hybrid AC:SLG/FLG-based SC shows a 30% increase of specific capacitance (Cg) compared to the reference device, i.e., the AC-based one (Cg from 76.8 F g-1 to 98.2 F g-1). At higher CD current densities (>1 A g-1), the AC-based device displays a resistive behaviour, while the AC:SLG/FLG-based SCs still exhibit a Cg of 23.9 and 5.2 F g-1 at CD current densities as high as 2.5 and 5 A g-1, respectively. Beyond the control of the nanoporosity of carbon materials and the inter-ionic interaction of the electrolytes, the rationalization of the relationship between the nanotribology of nanocarbons and the performance of the corresponding SCs offers new opportunities to optimize the SC design compatibly with established high-throughput industrial manufacturing.. 2019\n",

            "Kdm7a expression is spatiotemporally regulated in developing Xenopus laevis embryos, and its overexpression influences late retinal development. Background: Post-translational histone modifications are among the most common epigenetic modifications that orchestrate gene expression, playing a pivotal role during embryonic development and in various pathological conditions. Among histone lysine demethylases, KDM7A, also known as KIAA1718 or JHDM1D, catalyzes the demethylation of H3K9me1/2 and H3K27me1/2, leading to transcriptional regulation. Previous data suggest that KDM7A plays a central role in several biological processes, including cell proliferation, commitment, differentiation, apoptosis, and maintenance. However, information on the expression pattern of KDM7A in whole organisms is limited, and its functional role is still unclear. Results: In Xenopus development, kdm7a is expressed early, undergoing spatiotemporal regulation in various organs and tissues, including the central nervous system and the eye. Focusing on retinal development, we found that kdm7a overexpression does not affect the expression of genes critically involved in early neural development and eye-field specification, whereas unbalances the distribution of neural cell subtypes in the mature retina by disfavoring the development of ganglion cells while promoting that of horizontal cells. Conclusions: Kdm7a is dynamically expressed during embryonic development, and its overexpression influences late retinal development, suggesting a potential involvement in the molecular machinery regulating the spatiotemporally ordered generation of retinal neuronal subtypes.. 2024\n",
            "Toward Repositioning Niclosamide for Antivirulence Therapy of Pseudomonas aeruginosa Lung Infections: Development of Inhalable Formulations through Nanosuspension Technology. Inhaled antivirulence drugs are currently considered a promising therapeutic option to treat Pseudomonas aeruginosa lung infections in cystic fibrosis (CF). We have recently shown that the anthelmintic drug niclosamide (NCL) has strong quorum sensing (QS) inhibiting activity against P. aeruginosa and could be repurposed as an antivirulence drug. In this work, we developed dry powders containing NCL nanoparticles that can be reconstituted in saline solution to produce inhalable nanosuspensions. NCL nanoparticles were produced by high-pressure homogenization (HPH) using polysorbate 20 or polysorbate 80 as stabilizers. After 20 cycles of HPH, all formulations showed similar properties in the form of needle-shape nanocrystals with a hydrodynamic diameter of approximately 450 nm and a zeta potential of -20 mV. Nanosuspensions stabilized with polysorbate 80 at 10% w/w to NCL (T80-10) showed an optimal solubility profile in simulated interstitial lung fluid. T80-10 was successfully dried into mannitol-based dry powder by spray drying. Dry powder (T80-10 DP) was reconstituted in saline solution and showed optimal in vitro aerosol performance. Both T80-10 and T80-10 DP were able to inhibit P. aeruginosa QS at NCL concentrations of 2.5-10 μM. NCL, and these formulations did not significantly affect the viability of CF bronchial epithelial cells in vitro at microbiologically active concentrations (i.e., ≤10 μM). In vivo acute toxicity studies in rats confirmed no observable toxicity of the NCL T80-10 DP formulation upon intratracheal administration at a concentration 100-fold higher than the anti-QS activity concentration. These preliminary results suggest that NCL repurposed in the form of inhalable nanosuspensions has great potential for the local treatment of P. aeruginosa lung infections as in the case of CF patients.. 2015\n",

Historical paper documents are susceptible to complex degradation processes, including biodeterioration, which can progressively compromise their aesthetic and structural integrity. This study analyses seventeenth century handwritten historical letters stored at the Correr Museum Library in Venice, Italy, exhibiting pronounced signs of biodeterioration. The techniques used encompassed traditional colony isolation on agar plates and proteomics analyses, employing nanoscale liquid chromatography coupled with high-resolution mass spectrometry (nano-LC–MS). Fluorescence microscopy was used for the first time in the historical paper biodeterioration context to supplement the conventional stereoscopic, optical, and scanning electron microscopic imaging techniques.

            "Arm muscle synergies enhance hand posture prediction in combination with forearm muscle synergies. Objective. We analyze and interpret arm and forearm muscle activity in relation with the kinematics of hand pre-shaping during reaching and grasping from the perspective of human synergistic motor control. Approach. Ten subjects performed six tasks involving reaching, grasping and object manipulation. We recorded electromyographic (EMG) signals from arm and forearm muscles with a mix of bipolar electrodes and high-density grids of electrodes. Motion capture was concurrently recorded to estimate hand kinematics. Muscle synergies were extracted separately for arm and forearm muscles, and postural synergies were extracted from hand joint angles. We assessed whether activation coefficients of postural synergies positively correlate with and can be regressed from activation coefficients of muscle synergies. Each type of synergies was clustered across subjects. Main results. We found consistency of the identified synergies across subjects, and we functionally evaluated synergy clusters computed across subjects to identify synergies representative of all subjects. We found a positive correlation between pairs of activation coefficients of muscle and postural synergies with important functional implications. We demonstrated a significant positive contribution in the combination between arm and forearm muscle synergies in estimating hand postural synergies with respect to estimation based on muscle synergies of only one body segment, either arm or forearm (p < 0.01). We found that dimensionality reduction of multi-muscle EMG root mean square (RMS) signals did not significantly affect hand posture estimation, as demonstrated by comparable results with regression of hand angles from EMG RMS signals. Significance. We demonstrated that hand posture prediction improves by combining activity of arm and forearm muscles and we evaluate, for the first time, correlation and regression between activation coefficients of arm muscle and hand postural synergies. Our findings can be beneficial for myoelectric control of hand prosthesis and upper-limb exoskeletons, and for biomarker evaluation during neurorehabilitation.. 2024\n",
            "Some Comments on Hydrogel and Cartilage Contact Mechanics and Friction. We discuss the origin of the low friction observed for some elastically soft materials, such as hydrogels and the human cartilage. When a soft elastic solid is squeezed against another solid in a fluid, if the nominal contact pressure is high enough, after long enough contact time the contact area percolates, resulting in islands of confined fluid. For charged surfaces, with charges of equal sign, the osmotic pressure in the area of “real contact” may be large enough to keep the surfaces separated at nanometer separation. In this case the solid contact pressure (here the osmotic pressure) in the area of “real contact” will be nearly independent of the external load. The finite surface separation in the area of “real contact” results in a very small (breakloose) friction force even after long time of stationary contact.. 2018\n",

            "Solving structured sparsity regularization with proximal methods. Proximal methods have recently been shown to provide effective optimization procedures to solve the variational problems defining the ℓ1 regularization algorithms. The goal of the paper is twofold. First we discuss how proximal methods can be applied to solve a large class of machine learning algorithms which can be seen as extensions of ℓ1 regularization, namely structured sparsity regularization. For all these algorithms, it is possible to derive an optimization procedure which corresponds to an iterative projection algorithm. Second, we discuss the effect of a preconditioning of the optimization procedure achieved by adding a strictly convex functional to the objective function. Structured sparsity algorithms are usually based on minimizing a convex (not strictly convex) objective function and this might lead to undesired unstable behavior. We show that by perturbing the objective function by a small strictly convex term we often reduce substantially the number of required computations without affecting the prediction performance of the obtained solution. © 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.. 2010\n",
            "Fully Screen-Printed, Flexible, and Scalable Organic Monolithic Thermoelectric Generators. Energy-harvesting technologies offer a sustainable, maintenance-free alternative to conventional energy-storage solutions in distributed low-power applications. Flexible thermoelectric generators (TEGs) can generate electric power from a temperature gradient, even on complex surfaces. Organic materials are ideal candidates for flexible TEGs due to their good solution-processability, natural abundance, low weight, and flexibility. Electronic and thermoelectric properties of organic materials have steadily progressed, while device architectures leveraging their advantages are largely missing. Here, a design and fabrication method are proposed for producing fully screen-printed, flexible monolithic organic TEGs scalable up to m2, compatible with any screen-printable ink. This approach is validated, along with its scalability, by printing TEGs composed of two different active inks, in three configurations, with up to 800 thermoelements, with performances well matching simulations based on materials parameters. It is demonstrated that by using an additive-free graphene ink, a remarkable power density of 15 nW cm−2 at ΔT = 29.5 K can be achieved, with an estimated weight-normalized power output of 1 µW g−1, highlighting a strong potential in portability. Owing to such power density, only limited areas are required to generate microwatts, sufficient for operating low-power electronic devices such as sensors, and wearables.. 2024\n",
            "Loss of GABAergic neurons in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex of Engrailed-2 null mutant mice: Implications for autism spectrum disorders. The homeobox-containing transcription factor Engrailed-2 (En2) is involved in patterning and neuronal differentiation of the midbrain/hindbrain region, where it is prominently expressed. En2 mRNA is also expressed in the adult mouse hippocampus and cerebral cortex, indicating that it might also function in these brain areas. Genome-wide association studies revealed that En2 is a candidate gene for autism spectrum disorders (ASD), and mice devoid of its expression (En2-/- mice) display anatomical, behavioral and clinical \"autistic-like\" features. Since reduced GABAergic inhibition has been proposed as a possible pathogenic mechanism of ASD, we hypothesized that the phenotype of En2-/- mice might include defective GABAergic innervation in the forebrain. Here we show that the Engrailed proteins are present in postnatal GABAergic neurons of the mouse hippocampus and cerebral cortex, and adult En2-/- mice show reduced expression of GABAergic marker mRNAs in these areas. In addition, reduction in parvalbumin (PV), somatostatin (SOM) and neuropeptide Y (NPY) expressing interneurons is detected in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex of adult En2-/- mice. Our results raise the possibility of a link between altered function of En2, anatomical deficits of GABAergic forebrain neurons and the pathogenesis of ASD. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.. 2013\n",
            "The role of lipase and α-amylase in the degradation of starch/poly(Caprolactone) fiber meshes and the osteogenic differentiation of cultured marrow stromal cells. The present work studies the influence of hydrolytic enzymes (α-amylase or lipase) on the degradation of fiber mesh scaffolds based on a blend of starch and poly(-caprolactone) (SPCL) and the osteogenic differentiation of osteogenic medium-expanded rat bone marrow stromal cells (MSCs) and subsequent formation of extracellular matrix on these scaffolds under static culture conditions. The biodegradation profile of SPCL fiber meshes was investigated using enzymes that are specifically responsible for the enzymatic hydrolysis of SPCL using concentrations similar to those found in human serum. These degradation studies were performed under static and dynamic conditions. After several degradation periods (3, 7, 14, 21, and 30 days), weight loss measurements and micro-computed tomography analysis (specifically porosity, interconnectivity, mean pore size, and fiber thickness) were performed. The SPCL scaffolds were seeded with rat MSCs and cultured for 8 and 16 days using complete osteogenic media with and without enzymes (α-amylase or lipase). Results indicate that culture medium supplemented with enzymes enhanced cell proliferation after 16 days of culture, whereas culture medium without enzymes did not. No calcium was detected in groups cultured with α-amylase or without enzymes after each time period, although groups cultured with lipase presented calcium deposition after the eighth day, showing a significant increase at the sixteenth day. Lipase appears to positively influence osteoblastic differentiation of rat MSCs and to enhance matrix mineralization. Furthermore, scanning electron microscopy images showed that the enzymes did not have a deleterious effect on the three-dimensional structure of SPCL fiber meshes, meaning that the scaffolds did not lose their structural integrity after 16 days. Confocal micrographs have shown cells to be evenly distributed and infiltrated within the SPCL fiber meshes up to 410 μm from the surface. This study demonstrates that supplementation of culture media with lipase holds great potential for the generation of bone tissue engineering constructs from MSCs seeded onto SPCL fiber meshes, because lipase enhances the osteoblastic differentiation of the seeded MSCs and promotes matrix mineralization without harming the structural integrity of the meshes over 16 days of culture. © 2009, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.. 2009\n",
            "Equivalent weight: Application of the assessment method on real task conducted by railway workers wearing a back support exoskeleton. Commonly used risk indexes, such as the NIOSH Lifting Index, do not capture the effect of exoskeletons. This makes it difficult for Health and Safety professionals to rigorously assess the benefit of such devices. The community requires a simple method to assess the effectiveness of back-support exoskeleton's (BSE) in possibly reducing ergonomic risk. The method introduced in this work is termed “Equivalent Weight” (EqW) and it proposes an interpretation of the effect built on the benefit delivered through reduced activation of the erector spinae (ES). This manifests itself as an apparent reduction of the lifted load perceived by the wearer. This work presents a pilot study where a practical application of the EqW method is used to assess the ergonomic risk in manual material handling (MMH) when using a back support exoskeleton (StreamEXO). The results are assessed by combining observational measurements from on-site testing with five different workers and quantitative measures of the muscle activity reduction achieved during laboratory evaluation with ten workers. These results will show that when lifting, lowering, and carrying a 19 kg load the StreamEXO can reduce risk by up to two levels (from “high” to “low”) in the target sub-tasks. The Lifting index (LI) was reduced up to 64% when examining specific sub-tasks and the worker's movement conduction.. 2024\n",
            "Evidence for ciliary pigment localization in colored ciliates and implications for their photosensory transduction chain: A confocal microscopy study. In this study we report for the first time the localization of a photoreceptor pigment in the cilia of the colored heterotrich ciliates Blepharisma japonicum red and blue form, Fabrea salina, and Stentor coeruleus, as result of a confocal microscopy investigation. Optical sectioning confocal microscopy has been used for studying the spatial distribution of the pigment in the cell body, surprisingly showing that, besides its expected presence in the cortical region immediately below the cell membrane, it is located in the cilia too. In order to ascertain possible differences in the pigment fluorescence properties along the cell body, we have measured emission spectra from different parts of it (anterior, posterior, and cilia). Our results clearly indicate that in all cases the spectra are the same, within experimental errors. Finally, we have evaluated the pigment relative fluorescence efficiency of these ciliates. In an ordered scale from lower to greater efficiency, we have S. coeruleus, B. japonicum blue, B. japonicum red, and F. salina.

            "Decoding population neuronal responses by topological clustering. In this paper the use of topological clustering for decoding population neuronal responses and reducing stimulus features is described. The discrete spike trains, recorded in rat somatosensory cortex in response to sinusoidal vibrissal stimulations characterised by different frequencies and amplitudes, are first interpreted to continuous temporal activities by convolving with a decaying exponential filter. Then the self-organising map is utilised to cluster the continuous responses. The result is a topologically ordered clustering of the responses with respect to the stimuli. The clustering is formed mainly along the product of amplitude and frequency of the stimuli. Such grouping agrees with the energy coding result obtained previously based on spike counts and mutual information. To further investigate how the clustering preserves information, the mutual information between resulting stimulus grouping and responses has been calculated. The cumulative mutual information of the clustering resembles closely that of the energy grouping. It suggests that topological clustering can naturally find underlying stimulus-response patterns and preserve information among the clusters. © 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.. 2008\n",

            "Biobased and biodegradable imine vitrimers from epoxidized soybean oil as packaging. A flexible and stretchable vitrimer was synthesized using exclusively biobased building blocks and following green chemistry principles. Epoxidized soybean oil (ESO), vanillin, the biobased diamine, Priamine®, and oleic acid were used to create a material that can replace fossil-derived, non-biodegradable packaging. Vanillin and Priamine® were used to develop a crosslinker that could react with the epoxide groups of ESO without the need for solvents, with a catalyst-free synthesis that does not generate any waste or byproducts. Oleic acid was incorporated, to tune the properties of the final material, since it can react with ESO and control the crosslink density. The vitrimers produced in this work showed excellent reprocessability and recyclability. They possess the ability to be molded, and they can also strongly adhere on surfaces. Moreover, they exhibited oxygen and water vapor barrier comparable to low density polyethylene, while showing very low migration into food simulant, which position them as a promising material for flexible food and general packaging market. The vitrimers showed also the capability of biodegradation in seawater, providing a safe end of life in case of mismanagement.. 2024\n",
            "Plasmonic quantum effects on single-emitter strong coupling. Coupling between electromagnetic cavity fields and fluorescent molecules or quantum emitters can be strongly enhanced by reducing the cavity mode volume. Plasmonic structures allow light confinement down to volumes that are only a few cubic nanometers. At such length scales, nonlocal and quantum tunneling effects are expected to influence the emitter interaction with the surface plasmon modes, which unavoidably requires going beyond classical models to accurately describe the electron response at the metal surface. In this context, the quantum hydrodynamic theory (QHT) has emerged as an efficient tool to probe nonlocal and quantum effects in metallic nanostructures. Here, we apply state-of-the-art QHT to investigate the quantum effects on strong coupling of a dipole emitter placed at nanometer distances from metallic particles. A comparison with conventional local response approximation (LRA) and Thomas-Fermi hydrodynamic theory results shows the importance of quantum effects on the plasmon-emitter coupling. The QHT predicts qualitative deviation from LRA in the weak coupling regime that leads to quantitative differences in the strong coupling regime. In nano-gap systems, the inclusion of quantum broadening leads to the existence of an optimal gap size for Rabi splitting that minimizes the requirements on the emitter oscillator strength.. 2019\n",

A comprehensive understanding of molecular changes during brain aging is essential to mitigate cognitive decline and delay neurodegenerative diseases. The interpretation of mRNA alterations during brain aging is influenced by the health and age of the animal cohorts studied. Here, we carefully consider these factors and provide an in-depth investigation of mRNA splicing and dynamics in the aging mouse brain, combining short- and long-read sequencing technologies with extensive bioinformatic analyses. Our findings encompass a spectrum of age-related changes, including differences in isoform usage, decreased mRNA dynamics and a module showing increased expression of neuronal genes. Notably, our results indicate a reduced abundance of mRNA isoforms leading to nonsense-mediated RNA decay and suggest a regulatory role for RNA-binding proteins, indicating that their regulation may be altered leading to the reshaping of the aged brain transcriptome. Collectively, our study highlights the importance of studying mRNA splicing events during brain aging.. 2024\n",
            "Coating Evaporated MAPI Thin Films with Organic Molecules: Improved Stability at High Temperature and Implementation in High-Efficiency Solar Cells. Methylammonium lead iodide (MAPI) has proven to be an exceptional light-absorber for single-junction thin-film solar cells. Nonetheless, degradation induced by environmental agents (air, moisture, heat) limits the stability of this hybrid perovskite. Here, we demonstrate that coating evaporated MAPI thin films with different hydrophobic molecules leads to a significant improvement in their stability. We especially investigated the degradation of MAPI and the subsequent formation of PbI2 at 150 °C by in situ XRD analysis and showed that this transformation is remarkably slowed down in films coated with trioctyl phosphine oxide and tridodecyl methylammonium iodide. This enhances the processability of such films, which is an important aspect for the fabrication of thin-film devices. Eventually, we demonstrate that such protected films can be implemented in single-junction n-i-p solar cells without any loss in the device efficiency.. 2018\n",

            "Hepatitis Delta Virus histone mimicry drives the recruitment of chromatin remodelers for viral RNA replication. Hepatitis Delta virus (HDV) is a satellite of Hepatitis B virus with a single-stranded circular RNA genome. HDV RNA genome synthesis is carried out in infected cells by cellular RNA polymerases with the assistance of the small hepatitis delta antigen (S-HDAg). Here we show that S-HDAg binds the bromodomain (BRD) adjacent to zinc finger domain 2B (BAZ2B) protein, a regulatory subunit of BAZ2B-associated remodeling factor (BRF) ISWI chromatin remodeling complexes. shRNA-mediated silencing of BAZ2B or its inactivation with the BAZ2B BRD inhibitor GSK2801 impairs HDV replication in HDV-infected human hepatocytes. S-HDAg contains a short linear interacting motif (SLiM) KacXXR, similar to the one recognized by BAZ2B BRD in histone H3. We found that the integrity of the S-HDAg SLiM sequence is required for S-HDAg interaction with BAZ2B BRD and for HDV RNA replication. Our results suggest that S-HDAg uses a histone mimicry strategy to co-activate the RNA polymerase II-dependent synthesis of HDV RNA and sustain HDV replication.. 2020\n",
            "Excimer based fluorescent pyrene-ferritin conjugate for protein oligomerization studies and imaging in living cells. Ferritin self-assembly has been widely exploited for the synthesis of a variety of nanoparticles for drug-delivery and diagnostic applications. However, despite the crucial role of ferritin self-assembly mechanism for probes encapsulation, little is known about the principles behind the oligomerization mechanism. In the present work, the novel \"humanized\" chimeric Archaeal ferritin HumAfFt, displaying the transferrin receptor-1 (TfR1) recognition motif typical of human H homopolymer and the unique salt-triggered oligomerization properties of Archaeoglobus fulgidus ferritin (AfFt), was site-selectively labeled with N-(1-pyrenyl)maleimide on a topologically selected cysteine residue inside the protein cavity, next to the dimer interface. Pyrene characteristic fluorescence features were exploited to investigate the transition from a dimeric to a cage-like 24-meric state and to visualize the protein in vitro by two photon fluorescence microscopy. Indeed, pyrene fluorescence changes upon ferritin self-assembly allowed to establish, for the first time, the kinetic and thermodynamic details of the archaeal ferritins oligomerization mechanism. In particular, the magnesium induced oligomerization proved to be faster than the monovalent cation-triggered process, highly cooperative, complete at low MgCl2 concentrations, and reversed by treatment with EDTA. Moreover, pyrene intense excimer fluorescence was successfully visualized in vitro by two photon fluorescence microscopy as pyrene-labeled HumAfFt was actively uptaken into HeLa cells by human transferrin receptor TfR1 recognition, thus representing a unique nano-device building block for two photon fluorescence cell imaging.. 2018\n",

            "Ubiquitin-dependent endocytosis of NKG2D-DAP10 receptor complexes activates signaling and functions in human NK cells. Cytotoxic lymphocytes share the presence of the activating receptor NK receptor group 2, member D (NKG2D) and the signaling-competent adaptor DNAX-Activating protein 10 (DAP10), which together play an important role in antitumor immune surveillance. Ligand stimulation induces the internalization of NKG2D-DAP10 complexes and their delivery to lysosomes for degradation. In experiments with human NK cells and cell lines, we found that the ligand-induced endocytosis of NKG2D-DAP10 depended on the ubiquitylation ofDAP10, which was also required for degradation of the internalized complexes. Moreover, through combined biochemical and microscopic analyses, we showed that ubiquitin-dependent receptor endocytosis was required for the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and NK cell functions, such as the secretion of cytotoxic granules and the inflammatory cytokine interferon-g. These results suggest that NKG2D-DAP10 endocytosis represents a means to decrease cell surface receptor abundance, as well as to control signaling outcome in cytotoxic lymphocytes.. 2015\n",

Immersive technology, such as extended reality, holds promise as a tool for educating ophthalmologists about the effects of low vision and for enhancing visual rehabilitation protocols. However, immersive simulators have not been evaluated for their ability to induce changes in the oculomotor system, which is crucial for understanding the visual experiences of visually impaired individuals. This study aimed to assess the REALTER (Wearable Egocentric Altered Reality Simulator) system’s capacity to induce specific alterations in healthy individuals’ oculomotor systems under simulated low-vision conditions. We examined task performance, eye movements, and head movements in healthy participants across various simulated scenarios. Our findings suggest that REALTER can effectively elicit behaviors in healthy individuals resembling those observed in individuals with low vision. Participants with simulated binocular maculopathy demonstrated unstable fixations and a high frequency of wide saccades. Individuals with simulated homonymous hemianopsia showed a tendency to maintain a fixed head position while executing wide saccades to survey their surroundings. Simulation of tubular vision resulted in a significant reduction in saccade amplitudes. REALTER holds promise as both a training tool for ophthalmologists and a research instrument for studying low vision conditions. The simulator has the potential to enhance ophthalmologists’ comprehension of the limitations imposed by visual disabilities, thereby facilitating the development of new rehabilitation protocols.. 2024\n",

            "Estimating Koopman operators with sketching to provably learn large scale dynamical systems. The theory of Koopman operators allows to deploy non-parametric machine learning algorithms to predict and analyze complex dynamical systems. Estimators such as principal component regression (PCR) or reduced rank regression (RRR) in kernel spaces can be shown to provably learn Koopman operators from finite empirical observations of the system's time evolution. Scaling these approaches to very long trajectories is a challenge and requires introducing suitable approximations to make computations feasible. In this paper, we boost the efficiency of different kernel-based Koopman operator estimators using random projections (sketching). We derive, implement and test the new “sketched” estimators with extensive experiments on synthetic and large-scale molecular dynamics datasets. Further, we establish non asymptotic error bounds giving a sharp characterization of the trade-offs between statistical learning rates and computational efficiency. Our empirical and theoretical analysis shows that the proposed estimators provide a sound and efficient way to learn large scale dynamical systems. In particular our experiments indicate that the proposed estimators retain the same accuracy of PCR or RRR, while being much faster.

Light scattering by two cases, a hemispherical solid immersion lens (HSIL) and a sphere when illuminated by a focused polarized beam, are discussed. There is a difference between the scattering coefficients of the two scatterers due to multiple reflections inside the sphere, which do not occur in the HSIL. We also derive the Debye series (DS) for the scattering coefficients of the sphere in a focused polarized beam. The DS is derived in a simple and straightforward manner in both mathematical and physical aspects. The applicability of generalized Lorenz-Mie theory (GLMT) is then discussed in terms of the definitions of the incident focused beam.

            "MiR-30e and miR-181d control Radial Glia cell proliferation via HtrA1 modulation. The precise mechanisms by which microRNAs (miRNAs) contribute to the dynamic regulation of gene expression during the forebrain development are still partly elusive. Here we show that the depletion of miRNAs in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus, via genetic inactivation of Dicer after the onset of forebrain neurogenesis, profoundly impairs the morphological and proliferative characteristics of neural stem and progenitor cells. The cytoarchitecture and self-renewal potential of radial glial (RG) cells located within the cerebral cortex and the hippocampus were profoundly altered, thus causing a significant derangement of both the post natal dorsal sub-ventricular zone and the dentate gyrus. This effect was attributed to the High-temperature requirement A serine peptidase 1 (HtrA1) gene product whose overexpression in the developing forebrain recapitulated some of the aspects of the Dicer -/- phenotype. MiR-30e and miR-181d were identified as posttranscriptional negative regulators of HtrA1 by binding to its 3′ untranslated region.

Nonlinear dynamical systems can be handily described by the associated Koopman operator, whose action evolves every observable of the system forward in time.Learning the Koopman operator and its spectral decomposition from data is enabled by a number of algorithms.In this work we present for the first time non-asymptotic learning bounds for the Koopman eigenvalues and eigenfunctions.We focus on time-reversal-invariant stochastic dynamical systems, including the important example of Langevin dynamics.We analyze two popular estimators: Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition (EDMD) and Reduced Rank Regression (RRR).Our results critically hinge on novel minimax estimation bounds for the operator norm error, that may be of independent interest.Our spectral learning bounds are driven by the simultaneous control of the operator norm error and a novel metric distortion functional of the estimated eigenfunctions.The bounds indicates that both EDMD and RRR have similar variance, but EDMD suffers from a larger bias which might be detrimental to its learning rate.Our results shed new light on the emergence of spurious eigenvalues, an issue which is well known empirically.Numerical experiments illustrate the implications of the bounds in practice.. 2023\n",

We investigated the ability of children with ASD to discriminate a small cylinder from a large cube by observing a point-light movie of an actor grasping the object, either from an allocentric or egocentric viewpoint (observing action of others or self). Compared with typically developing controls, high functioning autistic children showed a strong selective impairment in this task, but only with the allocentric viewpoint, where thresholds were twice as high: egocentric thresholds were similar to age- and ability-matched controls. The magnitude of the impairment correlated strongly with the degree of symptomology (R2 = 0.5). The results suggest that children with ASD might be impaired in their ability to predict and infer the consequences of others' movements, which could be related to the social-communicative deficits often reported in autism.. 2017\n",
            "Walking the Route to GHz Solution-Processed Organic Electronics: A HEROIC Exploration. Limited charge carrier mobility of organic semiconductors, especially for solution-processed polymer thin films, has typically relegated organic electronics to low-frequency operation. Nevertheless, thanks to a steady increase in electronic properties of organics, much higher operation frequencies are feasible, suggesting a possible and appealing scenario where lightweight, cost-effective, and conformable electronics can integrate both sensing and radio-frequency transmitting functionalities, which are the key to unlock pervasive networks of distributed sensors revolutionizing human–environment interaction. Few years ago, it was suggested that gigahertz (GHz) field-effect transistors could be achievable even with solution-based processes.

Here, the authors report their vision toward the achievement of radio-frequency organic electronics mainly with solution-based and scalable processes, with reference to the experience of the HEROIC project and to some of the most notable literature examples. The authors show that the achievement of solution-processable organic field-effect transistors with GHz operation is indeed feasible, but requires considering a carefully revised scenario in which the main role is played by charge injection, together with the geometric overlap, the capacitive parasitism associated to fringing and some constraints on the dielectric layer thickness.. 2020\n",

            "Information theoretical kernels for generative embeddings based on hidden markov models. Many approaches to learning classifiers for structured objects (e.g., shapes) use generative models in a Bayesian framework. However, state-of-the-art classifiers for vectorial data (e.g., support vector machines) are learned discriminatively. A generative embedding is a mapping from the object space into a fixed dimensional feature space, induced by a generative model which is usually learned from data. The fixed dimensionality of these feature spaces permits the use of state of the art discriminative machines based on vectorial representations, thus bringing together the best of the discriminative and generative paradigms. Using a generative embedding involves two steps: (i) defining and learning the generative model used to build the embedding; (ii) discriminatively learning a (maybe kernel) classifier on the adopted feature space. The literature on generative embeddings is essentially focused on step (i), usually adopting some standard off-the-shelf tool (e.g., an SVM with a linear or RBF kernel) for step (ii). In this paper, we follow a different route, by combining several Hidden Markov Models-based generative embeddings (including the classical Fisher score) with the recently proposed non-extensive information theoretic kernels. We test this methodology on a 2D shape recognition task, showing that the proposed method is competitive with the state-of-art. © 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.. 2010\n",

            "Noise enhances action potential generation in mouse sensory neurons via stochastic resonance. Noise can enhance perception of tactile and proprioceptive stimuli by stochastic resonance processes. However, the mechanisms underlying this general phenomenon remain to be characterized. Here we studied how externally applied noise influences action potential firing in mouse primary sensory neurons of dorsal root ganglia, modelling a basic process in sensory perception. Since noisy mechanical stimuli may cause stochastic fluctuations in receptor potential, we examined the effects of sub-threshold depolarizing current steps with superimposed random fluctuations. We performed whole cell patch clamp recordings in cultured neurons of mouse dorsal root ganglia. Noise was added either before and during the step, or during the depolarizing step only, to focus onto the specific effects of external noise on action potential generation. In both cases, step + noise stimuli triggered significantly more action potentials than steps alone. The normalized power norm had a clear peak at intermediate noise levels, demonstrating that the phenomenon is driven by stochastic resonance. Spikes evoked in step + noise trials occur earlier and show faster rise time as compared to the occasional ones elicited by steps alone. These data suggest that external noise enhances, via stochastic resonance, the recruitment of transient voltage-gated Na channels, responsible for action potential firing in response to rapid step-wise depolarizing currents.. 2016\n",
            "Optimizing Gold-Assisted Exfoliation of Layered Transition Metal Dichalcogenides with (3-Aminopropyl)triethoxysilane (APTES): A Promising Approach for Large-Area Monolayers. Two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (2D TMDCs) have gained significant attention from the scientific community due to their exceptional properties. Recently, the metal-assisted exfoliation technique has emerged as a promising method for producing large-area, high-quality 2D monolayers. However, achieving strong adhesion between metal foil and substrate during the exfoliation process remains a major challenge, preventing successful exfoliation. To overcome this issue, this study explores the application of (3-Aminopropyl)triethoxysilane (APTES) as an adhesion layer to substantially improve adhesion between the monolayers and hydrophilic substrates such as SiO2, allowing for a high yield of mm-sized monolayers. Two sample sets, obtained from the same MoS2 crystal via gold-assisted exfoliation with APTES-treated substrates and from standard scotch tape exfoliation, are statistically compared. APTES significantly improves exfoliation performance, yielding larger monolayers compared to conventional methods. This improvement enables the effective exfoliation with the gold-tape method, which otherwise results in no yield. Through Raman and photoluminescence characterization techniques, it is found that the flakes obtained from gold-assisted exfoliation and APTES are comparable to those obtained by standard scotch-tape exfoliation in terms of defects and optical properties, showing signatures of strain-induced Raman shift and n-type doping.. 2024\n",
            "Platinum-decorated graphene: Experimental insight into growth mechanisms and hydrogen adsorption properties. Pt-functionalized graphene shows promise for near-ambient hydrogen storage due to graphene's potential as a hydrogen host and platinum's role as a catalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction and spillover effect. This study explores Pt cluster formation on epitaxial graphene and its suitability for hydrogen storage. Scanning Tunneling Microscopy reveals two growth pathways. Initially, up to ∼1 monolayer of Pt coverage, Pt tends to randomly disperse and cover the graphene surface, whereas the cluster height remains unchanged. Beyond a coverage of 3 monolayer, the nucleation of new layers on existing clusters becomes predominant, and the clusters mainly grow in height. Thermal Desorption Spectroscopy on hydrogenated Pt-decorated graphene reveals the presence of multiple hydrogen adsorption mechanisms. Two Gaussian peaks, which we attribute to hydrogen physisorbed (peak at 155°C) and chemisorbed (peak at 430°C) on the surface of Pt clusters are superimoposed on a linearly increasing background assigned to hydrogen bonded in the bulk of the Pt clusters. These measurements demonstrate the ability of Pt-functionalized graphene to store molecular hydrogen at temperatures that are high enough for stable hydrogen binding at room temperature.. 2024\n",

            "An Online Learning Procedure for Feedback Linearization Control without Torque Measurements. By exploiting an a-priori estimate of the dynamic model of a manipulator, it is possible to command joint torques which ideally realize a Feedback Linearization (FL) controller. The exact cancellation may nevertheless not be achieved due to model uncertainties and possible errors in the estimation of the dynamic coefficients. In this work, an online learning scheme for control based on FL is presented. By reading joint positions and joint velocities information only (without the use of any torque measurement), we are able to learn those model uncertainties and thus achieve perfect FL control.

This research report introduces a learning system designed to detect the object that humans are gazing at, using solely visual feedback. By incorporating face detection, human attention prediction, and online object detection, the system enables the robot to perceive and interpret human gaze accurately, thereby facilitating the establishment of joint attention with human partners. Additionally, a novel dataset collected with the humanoid robot iCub is introduced, comprising more than 22,000 images from ten participants gazing at different annotated objects. This dataset serves as a benchmark for human gaze estimation in table-top human–robot interaction (HRI) contexts.

Furthermore, the developed system is deployed on the iCub and showcases its functionality. The results demonstrate the potential of the proposed approach as a first step to enhancing social awareness and responsiveness in social robotics.

            "I2EDL: Interactive Instruction Error Detection and Localization. In the Vision-and-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments (VLN-CE) task, the human user guides an autonomous agent to reach a target goal via a series of low-level actions following a textual instruction in natural language. However, most existing methods do not address the likely case where users may make mistakes when providing such instruction (e.g., \"turn left\"instead of \"turn right\"). In this work, we address a novel task of Interactive VLN in Continuous Environments (IVLN-CE), which allows the agent to interact with the user during the VLN-CE navigation to verify any doubts regarding the instruction errors. We propose an Interactive Instruction Error Detector and Localizer (I2EDL) that triggers the user-agent interaction upon the detection of instruction errors during the navigation. We leverage a pre-trained module to detect instruction errors and pinpoint them in the instruction by cross-referencing the textual input and past observations. In such way, the agent is able to query the user for a timely correction, without demanding the user's cognitive load, as we locate the probable errors to a precise part of the instruction. We evaluate the proposed I2EDL on a dataset of instructions containing errors, and further devise a novel metric, the Success weighted by Interaction Number (SIN), to reflect both the navigation performance and the interaction effectiveness. We show how the proposed method can ask focused requests for corrections to the user, which in turn increases the navigation success, while minimizing the interactions.. 2024\n",
            "Branched amphiphilic polysulfides: Influence of macromolecular architecture on self-assembly and oxidation responsiveness. 2-, 4-, 6- and 8-arm star amphiphilic block copolymers were prepared with the branching point located in the hydrophobic core composed of polypropylene sulfide) (PPS); poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) pendant chains completed the macromolecular structure. The level of branching influenced the rigidity of the PPS core and of the overall macromolecule, with the Mark-Houwink parameter a gradually approaching the value typical of globules for 6 and 8 arms. A binary behavior (linear vs. branched) was noticed for the kinetics of oxidation by H2O2 and the stability of the colloidal aggregates formed in water: irrespective of the number of arms, all branched polymers showed a slower response (to oxidation) and a more stable hydrophobic domains (a critical micellar concentration < 0.01 mg/mL).. 2015\n",

This paper presents a control law that induces stable bounding on a model of the quadrupedal robot HyQ designed specifically for highly-dynamic locomotion. The controller integrates active compliance and torque planning with the framework of hybrid zero dynamics. Exploiting the hybrid nature of the system, the control action is developed in both continuous and discrete time to regulate the torque applied at the support leg and the motion of the swing leg. It is demonstrated that the proposed control law is capable of producing stable periodic bounding gaits.

            "Differential involvement of somatosensory and interoceptive cortices during the observation of affective touch. Previous studies suggested that the observation of other individuals ' somatosensory experiences also activates brain circuits processing one's own somatosensory experiences. However, it is unclear whether cortical regions involved with the elementary stages of touch processing are also involved in the automatic coding of the affective consequences of observed touch and to which extent they show overlapping activation for somatosensory experiences of self and others. In order to investigate these issues, in the present fMRI study, healthy participants either experienced touch or watched videos depicting other individuals' inanimate and animate/social touch experiences. Essentially, a distinction can be made between exteroceptive and interoceptive components of touch processing, involved with physical stimulus characteristics and internal feeling states, respectively. Consistent with this distinction, a specific negative modulation was found in the posterior insula by the mere visual perception of other individuals' social or affective cutaneous experiences, compared to neutral inanimate touch. On the other hand, activation in secondary somatosensory and posterior superior temporal regions, strongest for the most intense stimuli, seemed more dependent on the observed physical stimulus characteristics. In contrast to the detected vicarious activation in somatosensory regions, opposite activation patterns for the experience (positive modulation) and observation (negative modulation) of touch suggest that the posterior insula does not reflect a shared representation of self and others' experiences. Embedded in a distributed network of brain regions underpinning a sense of the bodily self, the posterior insula rather appears to differentiate between self and other conditions when affective experiences are implicated. © 2011 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.. 2011\n",

Oral malignancies continue to have severe morbidity with less than 50% long-term survival despite the advancement in the available therapies. There is a persisting demand for new approaches to establish more efficient strategies for their treatment. In this regard, the human topoisomerase II (topoII) enzyme is a validated chemotherapeutics target, as topoII regulates vital cellular processes such as DNA replication, transcription, recombination, and chromosome segregation in cells. TopoII inhibitors are currently used to treat some neoplasms such as breast and small cells lung carcinomas. Additionally, topoII inhibitors are under investigation for the treatment of other cancer types, including oral cancer. Here, we report the therapeutic effect of a tetrahydroquinazoline derivative (named ARN21934) that preferentially inhibits the alpha isoform of human topoII. The treatment efficacy of ARN21934 has been evaluated in 2D cell cultures, 3D in vitro systems, and in chick chorioallantoic membrane cancer models. Overall, this work paves the way for further preclinical developments of ARN21934 and possibly other topoII alpha inhibitors of this promising chemical class as a new chemotherapeutic approach for the treatment of oral neoplasms.. 2024\n",

In this paper, we present a study on peculiar plant root movements, named circumnutations, adopted by plants as an efficient strategy to penetrate the soil and implemented in robotic roots to improve their performance in exploration tasks. The robotic root is able to bend and interact with soil owing to a soft actuation mechanism based on the translation of rotary to linear motion by means of helical compression springs. The robotic root integrates a stimulus-oriented behavior combined with circumnutation movements, which leads to an extraordinarily large reduction (more than 80 times) of the force needed for penetration in artificial soil (sawdust) while performing circumnutations with respect to a straightforward movement.. 2016\n",

State of the art density functional theory approaches are employed to provide an accurate description of the photophysical properties of azodyes and Schiff bases displaying intramolecular hydrogen-bonding features. These compounds exist as tautomeric mixtures at the ground state and, in the case of Schiff bases, an excited-state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) occurs upon excitation. The experimentally observed photophysical properties are discussed here in light of the theoretical findings. To rationalize the different experimentally observed radiative behavior of the azo and azomethine structures, a nonradiative decay pathway that is possibly active in such systems is determined. The characterization of this deactivation path, tested for two related compounds exhibiting different fluorescence quantum yields, enables us to disentangle the different and contrasting effects governing the excited-state behavior of these molecular systems.. 2015\n",
            "The impact of Compositionality in Zero-shot Multi-label action recognition for Object-based tasks. Addressing multi-label action recognition in videos represents a significant challenge for robotic applications in dynamic environments, especially when the robot is required to cooperate with humans in tasks that involve objects. Existing methods still struggle to recognize unseen actions or require extensive training data. To overcome these problems, we propose Dual-VCLIP, a unified approach for zero-shot multi-label action recognition. Dual-VCLIP enhances VCLIP, a zero-shot action recognition method, with the DualCoOp method for multi-label image classification. The strength of our method is that at training time it only learns two prompts, and it is therefore much simpler than other methods. We validate our method on the Charades dataset that includes a majority of object-based actions, demonstrating that - despite its simplicity - our method performs favorably with respect to existing methods on the complete dataset, and promising performance when tested on unseen actions. Our contribution emphasizes the impact of verb-object class-splits during robots' training for new cooperative tasks, highlighting the influence on the performance and giving insights into mitigating biases.

            "SRL-VIC: A Variable Stiffness-Based Safe Reinforcement Learning for Contact-Rich Robotic Tasks. Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising paradigm in complex and continuous robotic tasks, however, safe exploration has been one of the main challenges, especially in contact-rich manipulation tasks in unstructured environments. Focusing on this issue, we propose SRL-VIC: a model-free safe RL framework combined with a variable impedance controller (VIC). Specifically, safety critic and recovery policy networks are pre-trained where safety critic evaluates the safety of the next action using a risk value before it is executed and the recovery policy suggests a corrective action if the risk value is high. Furthermore, the policies are updated online where the task policy not only achieves the task but also modulates the stiffness parameters to keep a safe and compliant profile. A set of experiments in contact-rich maze tasks demonstrate that our framework outperforms the baselines (without the recovery mechanism and without the VIC), yielding a good trade-off between efficient task accomplishment and safety guarantee. We show our policy trained on simulation can be deployed on a physical robot without fine-tuning, achieving successful task completion with robustness and generalization.. 2024\n",

            "Effects of fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) inhibitors on working memory in rats. Rationale: Manipulations of the endocannabinoid system could potentially produce therapeutic effects with minimal risk of adverse cannabis-like side effects. Inhibitors of fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) increase endogenous levels of the cannabinoid-receptor agonist, anandamide, and show promise for treating a wide range of disorders. However, their effects on learning and memory have not been fully characterized. Objectives: We determined the effects of five structurally different FAAH inhibitors in an animal model of working memory known to be sensitive to impairment by delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). Methods: A delayed nonmatching-to-position procedure was used in rats. Illuminated nosepoke holes were used to provide sample cues (left versus right) and record responses (correct versus incorrect) after delays ranging from 0 to 28 s. Various test drugs were given acutely up to two times per week before daily sessions. Results: One FAAH inhibitor, AM3506 (3 mg/kg), decreased accuracy in the memory task. Four other FAAH inhibitors (URB597, URB694, PF-04457845, and ARN14633) and a monoacylglycerol lipase inhibitor (JZL184, which blocks the degradation of the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol) had no effect. Testing of AM3506 in combination with antagonists for receptors known to be affected by anandamide and other fatty acid amides indicated that the impairment induced by AM3506 was mediated by cannabinoid CB1 receptors, and not by alpha-type peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR-alpha) or vanilloid transient receptor potential cation channels (TRPV1). Conclusions: FAAH inhibitors differ with respect to their potential for memory impairment, abuse liability, and probably other cannabis-like effects, and they should be evaluated individually for specific therapeutic and adverse effects.. 2016\n",

            "Dependence of Immunoglobulin Class Switch Recombination in B Cells on Vesicular Release of ATP and CD73 Ectonucleotidase Activity. Immunoglobulin (Ig) isotype diversification by class switch recombination (CSR) is an essential process for mounting a protective humoral immune response. Ig CSR deficiencies in humans can result from an intrinsic B cell defect; however, most of these deficiencies are still molecularly undefined and diagnosed as common variable immunodeficiency (CVID). Here, we show that extracellular adenosine critically contributes to CSR in human naive and IgM memory B cells. In these cells, coordinate stimulation of B cell receptor and toll-like receptors results in the release of ATP stored in Ca2+-sensitive secretory vesicles. Plasma membrane ectonucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase 1 CD39 and ecto-5'-nucleotidase CD73 hydrolyze ATP to adenosine, which induces CSR in B cells in an autonomous fashion. Notably, CVID patients with impaired class-switched antibody responses are selectively deficient in CD73 expression in B cells, suggesting that CD73-dependent adenosine generation contributes to the pathogenesis of this disease. © 2013 The Authors.. 2013\n",

The search for safe electrolytes to promote the application of lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries may be supported by the investigation of viscous glyme solvents. Hence, electrolytes using nonflammable tetraethylene glycol dimethyl ether added by lowly viscous 1,3-dioxolane (DOL) are herein thoroughly investigated for sustainable Li-S cells. The electrolytes are characterized by low flammability, a thermal stability of ∼200 °C, ionic conductivity exceeding 10-3 S cm-1 at 25 °C, a Li+ transference number of ∼0.5, electrochemical stability window from 0 to ∼4.4 V vs Li+/Li, and a Li stripping-deposition overpotential of ∼0.02 V. The progressive increase of the DOL content from 5 to 15 wt % raises the activation energy for Li+ motion, lowers the transference number, slightly limits the anodic stability, and decreases the Li/electrolyte resistance. The electrolytes are used in Li-S cells with a composite consisting of sulfur and multiwalled carbon nanotubes mixed in the 90:10 weight ratio, exploiting an optimized current collector. The cathode is preliminarily studied in terms of structure, thermal behavior, and morphology and exploited in a cell using standard electrolyte.

Their uniquely tuneable optical and electrical properties are underpinning a surge of interest in 2D-photovoltaics. So far, the development of nano-scale integrated opto-electronic 2D perovskite devices remains nearly unexplored since they have generally been found to be incompatible with standard top-down semiconductor nano-fabrication technologies.

            "Influence of nanodispersed hydrotalcite on polypropylene photooxidation. Nanocomposites containing hydrotalcite and prepared by melt compounding with polypropylene were UV-light irradiated in artificial accelerated conditions representative of solar irradiation (λ > 300 nm) at 60 °C in air. The chemical modifications resulting from photooxidation were followed by IR and UV-visible spectroscopies. The presence of hydrotalcite was shown to change the global rate of photooxidation of polypropylene by reducing the oxidation induction time and increasing the oxidation rate. The differences of the oxidation induction time disappeared after solvent extraction of the antioxidant. They were attributed to a quenching of the antioxidant activity resulting from a migration onto the filler surface induced by the preferential interaction with the polar hydrotalcite. Extracting the antioxidant did not change the oxidation rate at the permanent regime. The increase of the oxidation rate was attributed to transition metal ions, present as impurities in hydrotalcite, which can accelerate the oxidation of the polymer by various mechanisms including a catalysed decomposition of hydroperoxides. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

            "Sensorimotor Oscillations in Human Infants during an Innate Rhythmic Movement. The relationship between cerebral rhythms and early sensorimotor development is not clear. In recent decades, evidence revealed a rhythmic modulation involving sensorimotor processing. A widely corroborated functional role of oscillatory activity is to coordinate the information flow across sensorimotor networks. Their activity is coordinated by event-related synchronisation and desynchronisation in different sensorimotor rhythms, which indicate parallel processes may be occurring in the neuronal network during movement. To date, the dynamics of these brain oscillations and early sensorimotor development are unexplored. Our study investigates the relationship between the cerebral rhythms using EEG and a typical rhythmic movement of infants, the non-nutritive sucking (NNS) behaviour. NNS is an endogenous behaviour that originates from the suck central pattern generator in the brainstem. We find, in 17 infants, that sucking frequency correlates with beta synchronisation within the sensorimotor area in two phases: one strongly anticipating (~3 s) and the other encompassing the start of the motion. These findings suggest that a beta synchronisation of the sensorimotor cortex may influence the sensorimotor dynamics of NNS activity. Our results reveal the importance of rapid brain oscillations in infants and the role of beta synchronisation and their possible role in the communication between cortical and deep generators.. 2024\n",
            "Trap-Mediated Two-Step Sensitization of Manganese Dopants in Perovskite Nanocrystals. Halide perovskite nanocrystals hold promise for printable optoelectronic and photonic applications. Doping enhances their functionalities and is being investigated for substituting lead with environmentally friendlier elements. The most investigated dopant is Mn 2+ that acts as a color center sensitized by the host excitons. The sensitization mechanism is far from understood and no comprehensive picture of the energy-transfer process has been proposed. Similarly, the role of shallow states, particularly abundant in defect tolerant materials, is still unknown. Here, we address this problem via spectroscopic studies at controlled excitation density and temperature on Mn:CsPbCl 3 nanocrystals. Our results indicate a two-step process involving exciton localization in a shallow metastable state that mediates the thermally assisted sensitization of the Mn 2+ emission, which is completely quenched for T < 200 K. At T ≤ 60 K, however, such emission surprisingly reappears, suggesting direct energy transfer from band-edge states. Electron spin resonance supports this picture, revealing the signatures of conformational rearrangements below 70 K, possibly removing the potential barrier for sensitization. Our results demystify anomalous behaviors of the exciton-to-Mn 2+ energy-transfer mechanism and highlight the role of shallow defects in the photophysics of doped perovskite nanostructures.. 2019\n",
            "Label-free ultra-sensitive visualization of structure below the diffraction resolution limit. For both fundamental study of biological processes and early diagnosis of diseases, information about nanoscale changes in tissue and cell structure is crucial. Nowadays, almost all currently known nanoscopy methods rely upon the contrast created by fluorescent stains attached to the object or molecule of interest. This causes limitations due to the impact of the label on the object and its environment, as well as its applicability in vivo, particularly in humans. In this paper, a new label-free approach to visualize small structure with nano-sensitivity to structural alterations is introduced. Numerically synthesized profiles of the axial spatial frequencies are used to probe the structure within areas whose size can be beyond the diffraction resolution limit. Thereafter, nanoscale structural alterations within such areas can be visualized and objects, including biological ones, can be investigated with sub-wavelength resolution, in vivo, in their natural environment. Some preliminary results, including numerical simulations and experiments, which demonstrate the nano-sensitivity and super-resolution ability of our approach, are presented.. 2018\n",

Action recognition has received enormous interest in the field of neuroscience over the last two decades. In spite of this interest, the knowledge in terms of fundamental neural mechanisms that provide constraints for underlying computations remains rather limited. This fact stands in contrast with a wide variety of speculative theories about how action recognition might work. This review focuses on new fundamental electrophysiological results in monkeys, which provide constraints for the detailed underlying computations. In addition, we review models for action recognition and processing that have concrete mathematical implementations, as opposed to conceptual models. We think that only such implemented models can be meaningfully linked quantitatively to physiological data and have a potential to narrow down the many possible computational explanations for action recognition. In addition, only concrete implementations allow judging whether postulated computational concepts have a feasible implementation in terms of realistic neural circuits.. 2015\n",

Circular dichroism and circularly polarized PL mirrored-signals for enantiomers are found in bulk samples, while in flakes, a degree of circularly polarized emission (P) of up to 17% at 80 K is achieved, comparable to Pb-based HOIPs. Moreover, angle-resolved PL measurements on flakes show that the PL emission and P are isotropic. These findings highlight the potential of these HOIPs from bulk to flakes for spin-optoelectronic applications.. 2024\n",
            "Metrics for Molecular Electronic Excitations: A Comparison between Orbital- and Density-Based Descriptors. This study proposes a quantitative and qualitative comparison of two popular metrics used for time-dependent density functional simulations of chromophores when describing absorption and emission processes, with high discrimination power between short- and long-range character of involved electronic excitations and functional performances. To this end, a total of 160 absorption and emission electronic excitations of 80 molecular systems belonging to the \"Real-Life Molecules\" data set, recently introduced in literature, have been considered a relevant data set. The two selected indexes are based on density (the DCT one) and natural transition orbitals (the ΔrNTO one), respectively. For comparison purposes, an extension of the DCT index, in line with what exists for ΔrNTO, enabling to discriminate electronic transitions occurring in symmetric systems is also proposed. The results show that, independently of the exchange and correlation functional used, a good correlation between the natural transition orbital and density based descriptors is found, thus cross validating their use for the quantification of a large variety of transitions in chemically relevant molecular systems.. 2017\n",
            "Blind Deblurring of THz Time-Domain Images Based on Low-Rank Representation. Terahertz (THz) time-domain imaging holds immense potential for material characterization, capturing threedimensional data across spatial and temporal dimensions. Despite its capabilities, the technology faces hurdles such as frequency-dependent beam-shape effects and noise. This paper proposes a novel, dual-stage framework for improving THz image resolution beyond the wavelength limit. Our method combats blur at lower frequencies and noise at higher frequencies. The first stage entails selective deblurring of lower-frequency bands, addressing beam-related blurring, while the second stage involves denoising the entire THz hyperspectral cube through dimensionality reduction, exploiting its low-rank structure. The synergy of these advanced techniques—beam shaping, noise removal, and low-rank representation—forms a comprehensive approach to enhance THz time-domain images. We present promising preliminary results, showcasing significant improvements across all frequency bands, which is crucial as samples may display varying features across the THz spectrum. Our ongoing work is extending this methodology to complex scenarios such as analyzing multilayered structures in closed ancient manuscripts. This approach paves the way for broader application and refinement of THz imaging in diverse research fields.. 2024\n",
            "Hydrogen storage with titanium-functionalized graphene. We report on hydrogen adsorption and desorption on titanium-covered graphene in order to test theoretical proposals to use of graphene functionalized with metal atoms for hydrogen storage. At room temperature, titanium islands grow on graphene with an average diameter of about 10 nm. Samples were then loaded with hydrogen, and its desorption kinetics was studied by thermal desorption spectroscopy. We observe the desorption of hydrogen in the temperature range between 400 K and 700 K. Our results demonstrate the stability of hydrogen binding at room temperature and show that hydrogen desorbs at moderate temperatures in line with what is required for practical hydrogen-storage applications. © 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.. 2013\n",

Momentum-resolved high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy has been used to probe the phonon dispersion of periodically rippled graphene grown on Ru(0001). Optical phonons in this system show anomalies with respect to other graphene/metal interfaces. Novel modes with weak intensity are observed at ∼86 and ∼150 meV. Moreover, the dispersion relation of the highest optical branches in the Γ-K direction strongly deviates from the expected behavior. These unusual features in the phonon dispersion should be related to the corrugated and chiral structure of the graphene overlayer on Ru(0001).. 2018\n",

Azopolymer films exposed to nonuniform illumination exhibit a phenomenon of light-induced mass transport, leading to the formation of permanent relief patterns on the film surface. Its underlying microscopic mechanism remains unclear, despite many years of research effort. Here we introduce a model of the mass migration process based on anisotropic light-driven molecular diffusion.

            "Single-photon microscopy to study biomolecular condensates. Biomolecular condensates serve as membrane-less compartments within cells, concentrating proteins and nucleic acids to facilitate precise spatial and temporal orchestration of various biological processes. The diversity of these processes and the substantial variability in condensate characteristics present a formidable challenge for quantifying their molecular dynamics, surpassing the capabilities of conventional microscopy. Here, we show that our single-photon microscope provides a comprehensive live-cell spectroscopy and imaging framework for investigating biomolecular condensation. Leveraging a single-photon detector array, single-photon microscopy enhances the potential of quantitative confocal microscopy by providing access to fluorescence signals at the single-photon level. Our platform incorporates photon spatiotemporal tagging, which allowed us to perform time-lapse super-resolved imaging for molecular sub-diffraction environment organization with simultaneous monitoring of molecular mobility, interactions, and nano-environment properties through fluorescence lifetime fluctuation spectroscopy. This integrated correlative study reveals the dynamics and interactions of RNA-binding proteins involved in forming stress granules, a specific type of biomolecular condensates, across a wide range of spatial and temporal scales. Our versatile framework opens up avenues for exploring a broad spectrum of biomolecular processes beyond the formation of membrane-less organelles.. 2023\n",
            "Micro- and nanorobots in Newtonian and biological viscoelastic fluids. Swimming microorganisms are a source of inspiration for small scale robots that are intended to operate in fluidic environments including complex biomedical fluids. Nature has devised swimming strategies that are effective at small scales and at low Reynolds number. These include the rotary corkscrew motion that, for instance, propels a flagellated bacterial cell, as well as the asymmetric beat of appendages that sperm cells or ciliated protozoa use to move through fluids. These mechanisms can overcome the reciprocity that governs the hydrodynamics at small scale. The complex molecular structure of biologically important fluids presents an additional challenge for the effective propulsion of microrobots. In this chapter it is shown how physical and chemical approaches are essential in realizing engineered abiotic micro- and nanorobots that can move in biomedically important environments. Interestingly, we also describe a microswimmer that is effective in biological viscoelastic fluids that does not have a natural analogue.. 2017\n",
            "Bi-directional heterologous desensitization between the major HIV-1 co-receptor CXCR4 and the κ-opioid receptor. We previously characterized multiple interactions between chemokine and opioid G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR), and we found both μ and δ-opioid receptors cross-desensitize CCR1, CCR2, CCR5, but not CXCR4. Here we report that the κ-opioid receptor (KOR) is able to cross-desensitize CXCR4, and this phenomenon is bi-directional. Chemotactic responses by KOR activation are diminished with prior activation of CXCR4. Additionally, calcium mobilization assays show these cross-desensitization processes occur within seconds of receptor activation, and target receptor internalization is not responsible for desensitization between these receptors. These results have implications for several essential processes including neuronal and lymphocyte development, inflammatory responses, and pain/sensitivity. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

            "A novel hidden Markov model-based pattern discrimination method with the anomaly detection for EMG signals. This paper proposes a novel sequential pattern recognition method enabling calculation of a posteriori probability for learned and unlearned classes. In this approach, probability density functions of unlearned classes are incorporated in a hiddenMarkov model to classify undefined classes via model parameter estimation using given learning samples. The technique can be applied to various pattern recognition problems such as motion classification with electromyogram (EMG) signals and in support for disease diagnosis. In the experiments conducted, motion classification from EMG signals was implemented with three subjects for eight learned/unlearned forearm motions. The proposed method produced higher levels of classification performance (learned motions: 90.13%; unlearned motions: 91.25%) than previous approaches. The results demonstrated the effectiveness of the technique.. 2017\n",

The paper addresses the issue of the role of non-linear muscle dynamics in determining the smoothness and invariance of handwriting trajectories. In particular, a specific neuromuscular control model is described that has recently been shown to explain the detailed time course of hand stiffness during arm reaching movements. In the paper the model is applied to more complex handwriting trajectories, with the purpose of verifying to which extent the load compensation capabilities of the periphery can subserve motor equivalence. Simulations show the power of the mechanism for movements of \"normal\" speed. For quicker movements periphery alone is not enough and a central load compensation action is clearly required. © 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.. 1998\n",
            "Combined in vivo effect of N-acylethanolamine-hydrolyzing acid amidase and glycogen synthase kinase-3β inhibition to treat multiple sclerosis. The current pharmacological approaches to multiple sclerosis (MS) target its inflammatory and autoimmune components, but effective treatments to foster remyelination and axonal repair are still lacking. We therefore selected two targets known to be involved in MS pathogenesis: N-acylethanolamine-hydrolyzing acid amidase (NAAA) and glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β). We tested whether inhibiting these targets exerted a therapeutic effect against experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of MS. The combined inhibition of NAAA and GSK-3β by two selected small-molecule compounds, ARN16186 (an NAAA inhibitor) and AF3581 (a GSK-3β inhibitor), effectively mitigated disease progression, rescuing the animals from paralysis and preventing a worsening of the pathology. The complementary activity of the two inhibitors reduced the infiltration of immune cells into the spinal cord and led to the formation of thin myelin sheaths around the axons post-demyelination. Specifically, the inhibition of NAAA and GSK-3β modulated the over-activation of NF-kB and STAT3 transcription factors in the EAE-affected mice and induced the nuclear translocation of β-catenin, reducing the inflammatory insult and promoting the remyelination process. Overall, this work demonstrates that the dual-targeting of key aspects responsible for MS progression could be an innovative pharmacological approach to tackle the pathology.. 2024\n",

            "Dynamic studies of antibody-antigen interactions with an electrolyte-gated organic transistor. Affinity-based biosensors employing surface-bound biomolecules for analyte detection are important tools in clinical diagnostics and drug development. In this context, electrolyte-gated organic transistors (EGOTs) are emerging as ultrasensitive label-free biosensors. In this study, we present an EGOT sensor integrated within a microfluidic system. The sensor utilizes the cytomegalovirus (CMV) phosphoprotein 65 as a biorecognition element to detect the pathological biomarker human anti-cytomegalovirus antibody in solution. The biorecognition element is grafted onto the gate electrode by exploiting the polyhistidine-tag technology. Real-time monitoring of the EGOT response, coupled with a two-compartment kinetic model analysis, enables the determination of analyte concentration, binding kinetics, and thermodynamics of the interaction. The analysis of the relevant kinetic parameters of the binding process yields a reliable value for the thermodynamic equilibrium constant and suggests that the measured deviations from the Langmuir binding model arise from the co-existence of binding sites with different affinities toward the antibodies.. 2024\n",
            "Wireless actuation with functional acoustic surfaces. Miniaturization calls for micro-actuators that can be powered wirelessly and addressed individually. Here, we develop functional surfaces consisting of arrays of acoustically resonant micro-cavities, and we demonstrate their application as two-dimensional wireless actuators. When remotely powered by an acoustic field, the surfaces provide highly directional propulsive forces in fluids through acoustic streaming. A maximal force of ∼0.45 mN is measured on a 4 × 4 mm2 functional surface. The response of the surfaces with bubbles of different sizes is characterized experimentally. This shows a marked peak around the micro-bubbles' resonance frequency, as estimated by both an analytical model and numerical simulations. The strong frequency dependence can be exploited to address different surfaces with different acoustic frequencies, thus achieving wireless actuation with multiple degrees of freedom. The use of the functional surfaces as wireless ready-to-attach actuators is demonstrated by implementing a wireless and bidirectional miniaturized rotary motor, which is 2.6 × 2.6 × 5 mm3 in size and generates a stall torque of ∼0.5 mN·mm. The adoption of micro-structured surfaces as wireless actuators opens new possibilities in the development of miniaturized devices and tools for fluidic environments that are accessible by low intensity ultrasound fields.. 2016\n",

In order to ease their translation towards real biomedical applications, simpler designs as well as cheaper yet more reliable materials and fabrication processes should be adopted, provided that the functionality of the microrobots can be kept. A simple single-hinge design could already enable microswimming in non-Newtonian fluids, which most bodily fluids are. Here, we address the fabrication of such single-hinge microrobots with a 3D-printed soft material. Firstly, a finite element model is developed to investigate the deformability of the 3D-printed microstructure under typical values of the actuating magnetic fields. Then the microstructures are fabricated by direct 3D-printing of a soft material and their swimming performances are evaluated. The speeds achieved with the 3D-printed microrobots are comparable to those obtained in previous work with complex fabrication procedures, thus showing great promise for 3D-printed microrobots to be operated in biological fluids.. 2015\n",

The importance of multisensory interaction for learning has increased with improved understanding of children's sensory development, and a flourishing interest in embodied cognition. The potential to foster new forms of multisensory interaction through various sensor, mobile and haptic technologies is promising in providing new ways for young children to engage with key mathematical concepts.

            "Remember Me -User-Centered Implementation of Working Memory Architectures on an Industrial Robot. The present research is innovative as we followed a user-centered approach to implement and train two working memory architectures on an industrial RB-KAIROS+ robot: GRU, a state-of-the-art architecture, and WorkMATe, a biologically-inspired alternative. Although usercentered approaches are essential to create a comfortable and safe HRI, they are still rare in industrial settings. Closing this research gap, we conducted two online user studies with large heterogeneous samples. The major aim of these studies was to evaluate the RB-KAIROS+ robot's appearance, movements, and perceived memory functions before (User Study 1) and after the implementation and training of robot working memory (User Study 2). In User Study 1, we furthermore explored participants' ideas about robot memory and what aspects of the robot's movements participants found positive and what aspects they would change. The effects of participants' demographic background and attitudes were controlled for. In User Study 1, participants' overall evaluations of the robot were moderate. Participant age and negative attitudes toward robots led to more negative robot evaluations. According to exploratory analyses, these effects were driven by perceived low experience with robots. Participants expressed clear ideas of robot memory and precise suggestions for a safe, efficient, and comfortable robot navigation which are valuable for further research and development. In User Study 2, the implementation of WorkMATe and GRU led to more positive evaluations of perceived robot memory, but not of robot appearance and movements. Participants' robot evaluations were driven by their positive views of robots. Our results demonstrate that considering potential users' views can greatly contribute to an efficient and positively perceived robot navigation, while users' experience with robots is crucial for a positive HRI.. 2023\n",

This study explores how humans and cognitive robots with different value systems and motivations understand each other's needs in free-form interactions. We developed a cognitive architecture that links sensing and perception to internal motivation and an intrinsic value system for determining actions. Inspired by young children's needs, this architecture includes three drives: learning, interaction, and recharging, each with varying dependence on the human partner. We aimed to assess how experimentally changing the importance of these drives within a fixed architecture affects interaction dynamics with human partners (acting as caregivers) and their understanding of the robot's needs. By adjusting the learning and interaction drives, we created two robot profiles: Playful, which prioritizes environmental exploration and playfulness to reduce boredom, and Social, which focuses on social interaction through touch and visual contact to increase comfort. Our findings show that changing the importance of these drives produces distinct behaviors and human perceptions. Robot behaviors matched their profiles, and participants adapted their responses accordingly. Participants identified and attributed distinct traits to each robot without knowing the specific profiles. Despite variability among human partners, the robots, especially the playful one, were generally well understood by most participants.. 2025\n",

Motion planning algorithms are designed to drive star formations and chain formations between any two configurations in their reachable sets.

            "Excitatory/inhibitory motor balance reflects individual differences during joint action coordination. Joint action (JA) is a continuous process of motor co-regulation based on the integration of contextual (top-down) and kinematic (bottom-up) cues from partners. The fine equilibrium between excitation and inhibition in sensorimotor circuits is, thus, central to such a dynamic process of action selection and execution. In a bimanual task adapted to become a unimanual JA task, the participant held a bottle (JA), while a confederate had to reach and unscrew either that bottle or another stabilized by a mechanical clamp (No_JA). Prior knowledge was manipulated in each trial such that the participant knew (K) or not (No_K) the target bottle in advance. Online transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was administered at action-relevant landmarks to explore corticospinal excitability (CSE) and inhibition (cortical silent period [cSP]). CSE was modulated early on before the action started if prior information was available. In contrast, cSP modulation emerged later during the reaching action, regardless of prior information. These two indexes could thus reflect the concurrent elaboration of contextual priors (top-down) and the online sampling of partner's kinematic cues (bottom-up). Furthermore, participants selected either one of two possible behavioural strategies, preferring early or late force exertion on the bottle. One translates into a reduced risk of motor coordination failure and the other into reduced metabolic expenditure. Each strategy was characterised by a specific excitatory/inhibitory profile. In conclusion, the study of excitatory/inhibitory balance paves the way for the neurophysiological determination of individual differences in the combination of top-down and bottom-up processing during JA coordination.. 2024\n",
            "Exploring Saliency for Learning Sensory-Motor Contingencies in Loco-Manipulation Tasks. The objective of this paper is to propose a framework for a robot to learn multiple Sensory-Motor Contingencies from human demonstrations and reproduce them. Sensory-Motor Contingencies are a concept that describes intelligent behavior of animals and humans in relation to their environment. They have been used to design control and planning algorithms for robots capable of interacting and adapting autonomously. However, enabling a robot to autonomously develop Sensory-Motor Contingencies is challenging due to the complexity of action and perception signals. This framework leverages tools from Learning from Demonstrations to have the robot memorize various sensory phases and corresponding motor actions through an attention mechanism. This generates a metric in the perception space, used by the robot to determine which sensory-motor memory is contingent to the current context. The robot generalizes the memorized actions to adapt them to the present perception. This process creates a discrete lattice of continuous Sensory-Motor Contingencies that can control a robot in loco-manipulation tasks. Experiments on a 7-dof collaborative robotic arm with a gripper, and on a mobile manipulator demonstrate the functionality and versatility of the framework.. 2024\n",
            "VERO: A vacuum-cleaner-equipped quadruped robot for efficient litter removal. Litter nowadays presents a significant threat to the equilibrium of many ecosystems. An example is the sea, where litter coming from coasts and cities via gutters, streets, and waterways, releases toxic chemicals and microplastics during its decomposition. Litter removal is often carried out manually by humans, which inherently lowers the amount of waste that can be effectively collected from the environment. In this paper, we present a novel quadruped robot prototype that, thanks to its natural mobility, is able to collect cigarette butts (CBs) autonomously, the second most common undisposed waste worldwide, in terrains that are hard to reach for wheeled and tracked robots. The core of our approach is a convolutional neural network for litter detection, followed by a time-optimal planner for reducing the time needed to collect all the target objects. Precise litter removal is then performed by a visual-servoing procedure which drives the nozzle of a vacuum cleaner that is attached to one of the robot legs on top of the detected CB. As a result of this particular position of the nozzle, we are able to perform the collection task without even stopping the robot's motion, thus greatly increasing the time-efficiency of the entire procedure. Extensive tests were conducted in six different outdoor scenarios to show the performance of our prototype and method. To the best knowledge of the authors, this is the first time that such a design and method was presented and successfully tested on a legged robot.. 2024\n",

Recent progress on the development of a new solid state detector allowed the use of finely pixelled photocathodes obtained from silicon semiconductors.

The main disadvantage of SiPM in this case is the poor sensitivity in the wavelength range 300-400 nm, where the Cherenkov light and fluorescence radiation are generated. We report on the possibility to realize a new kind of pixelled photodetector based on the use of silicon substrate with carbon nanotube compounds, more sensitive to the near UV radiation. Also if at the very beginning, the development of such detector appears very promising and useful for astroparticle physics, both in the ground based arrays and in the space experiments.

            "A regularized spectral algorithm for Hidden Markov Models with applications in computer vision. Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are among the most important and widely used techniques to deal with sequential or temporal data. Their application in computer vision ranges from action/gesture recognition to videosurveillance through shape analysis. Although HMMs are often embedded in complex frameworks, this paper focuses on theoretical aspects of HMM learning. We propose a regularized algorithm for learning HMMs in the spectral framework, whose computations have no local minima. Compared with recently proposed spectral algorithms for HMMs, our method is guaranteed to produce probability values which are always physically meaningful and which, on synthetic mathematical models, give very good approximations to true probability values. Furthermore, we place no restriction on the number of symbols and the number of states. On various pattern recognition data sets, our algorithm consistently outperforms classical HMMs, both in accuracy and computational speed. This and the fact that HMMs are used in vision as building blocks for more powerful classification approaches, such as generative embedding approaches or more complex generative models, strongly support spectral HMMs (SHMMs) as a new basic tool for pattern recognition. © 2012 IEEE.. 2012\n",

            "Nonvisual motor training influences biological motion perception. Experimental evidence suggests a link between perception and the execution of actions [1-12]. In particular, it has been proposed that motor programs might directly influence visual action perception [13]. According to this hypothesis, the acquisition of novel motor behaviors should improve their visual recognition, even in the absence of visual learning. We tested this prediction by using a new experimental paradigm that dissociates visual and motor learning during the acquisition of novel motor patterns. The visual recognition of gait patterns from point-light stimuli was assessed before and after nonvisual motor training. During this training, subjects were blindfolded and learned a novel coordinated upper-body movement based only on verbal and haptic feedback. The learned movement matched one of the visual test patterns. Despite the absence of visual stimulation during training, we observed a selective improvement of the visual recognition performance for the learned movement. Furthermore, visual recognition performance after training correlated strongly with the accuracy of the execution of the learned motor pattern. These results prove, for the first time, that motor learning has a direct and highly selective influence on visual action recognition that is not mediated by visual learning. ©2006 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.. 2006\n",
            "Group Meritocratic Fairness in Linear Contextual Bandits. We study the linear contextual bandit problem where an agent has to select one candidate from a pool and each candidate belongs to a sensitive group. In this setting, candidates' rewards may not be directly comparable between groups, for example when the agent is an employer hiring candidates from different ethnic groups and some groups have a lower reward due to discriminatory bias and/or social injustice. We propose a notion of fairness that states that the agent's policy is fair when it selects a candidate with highest relative rank, which measures how good the reward is when compared to candidates from the same group. This is a very strong notion of fairness, since the relative rank is not directly observed by the agent and depends on the underlying reward model and on the distribution of rewards. Thus we study the problem of learning a policy which approximates a fair policy under the condition that the contexts are independent between groups and the distribution of rewards of each group is absolutely continuous. In particular, we design a greedy policy which at each round constructs a ridge regression estimate from the observed context-reward pairs, and then computes an estimate of the relative rank of each candidate using the empirical cumulative distribution function. We prove that, despite its simplicity and the lack of an initial exploration phase, the greedy policy achieves, up to log factors and with high probability, a fair pseudo-regret of order dT‾‾‾√ after T rounds, where d is the dimension of the context vectors. The policy also satisfies demographic parity at each round when averaged over all possible information available before the selection. Finally, we use simulated settings and experiments on the US census data to show that our policy achieves sub-linear fair pseudo-regret also in practice.. 2022\n",

            "Adaptive Non-Linear Centroidal MPC With Stability Guarantees for Robust Locomotion of Legged Robots. Nonlinear model predictive locomotion controllers based on the reduced centroidal dynamics are nowadays ubiquitous in legged robots. These schemes, even if they assume an inherent simplification of the robot's dynamics, were shown to endow robots with a step-adjustment capability in reaction to small pushes, and in the case of uncertain parameters - as unknown payloads - they were shown to provide some \"practical\", albeit limited, robustness. In this work, we provide rigorous certificates of their closed-loop stability via reformulating the online centroidal MPC controller. This is achieved thanks to a systematic procedure inspired by the machinery of adaptive control, together with ideas coming from Control Lyapunov Functions. Our reformulation, in addition, provides robustness for a class of unmeasured constant disturbances. To demonstrate the generality of our approach, we validated our formulation on a new generation of humanoid robots - the 56.7 kg ergoCub, as well as on the commercially available 21 kg quadruped robot Aliengo.. 2025\n",
            "High throughput clogging free microfluidic particle filter by femtosecond laser micromachining. In recent decades, driven by the needs of industry and medicine, researchers have been investigating how to remove carefully from the main flow microscopic particles or clusters of them. Among all the approaches proposed, crossflow filtration is one of the most attractive as it provides a non-destructive, label-free and in-flow sorting method. In general, the separation performance shows capture and separation efficiencies ranging from 70% up to 100%. However, the maximum flow rate achievable (µL/min) is still orders of magnitude away from those suitable for clinical or industrial applications mainly due to the low stiffness of the materials typically used. In this work, we propose an innovative hydrodynamic-crossflow hybrid filter geometry, buried in a fused silica substrate by means of the femtosecond laser irradiation followed by chemical etching technique. The material high stiffness combined with the accuracy of our manufacturing technique allows the 3D fabrication of non-deformable channels with higher aspect ratio posts, while keeping the overall device dimensions compact. The filter performance has been validated through experiments with both Newtonian (water-based solution of microbeads) and non-Newtonian fluids (blood), achieving separation efficiencies of up to 94% and large particles recovery rates of 100%, even at very high flow rates (mL/h).. 2024\n",

We report on nanoscale patterning of GaAs (100) semiconductor substrates employing an ion projection through a self-organized stencil mask. The nanostructured mask, formed by ion beam sputtering of a polycrystalline Au film, allows driving the GaAs morphology strongly out of equilibrium. In a second stage, after the stencil mask is removed, we quantitatively follow the dynamical evolution of the forced system toward equilibrium by analyzing the evolution of the power spectral density of the height profiles and their slope and curvature distribution. Strong differences are observed by comparing the relaxation dynamics of GaAs surfaces which tend to smoothen with that of glass, a material which instead tends to non-linearly amplify the pattern once driven out of equilibrium by the stencil mask. © 2011 American Institute of Physics.. 2011\n",

The Industry 4.0 paradigm emphasizes the crucial benefits that collaborative robots, i.e., robots able to work alongside and together with humans, could bring to the whole production process. In this context, a yet unreached enabling technology is the design of robots able to deal at all levels with humans’ intrinsic variability, which is not only a necessary element to a comfortable working experience for humans, but also a precious capability for efficiently dealing with unexpected events. In this paper, a sensing, representation, planning and control architecture for flexible human–robot cooperation, referred to as FlexHRC, is proposed.

This result is achieved by suppressing the device dark currents while simultaneously preserving its external quantum efficiency, as high as 15% at 700 nm. To this aim, a thin cross-linked film based on poly[2-methoxy-5-(2′ -ethyl-hexyloxy)-1,4-phenylene-vinylene] is exploited to suppress electron injection from the device anode into the organic blend, thus reducing the dark currents by a factor of 30, to the extremely low value of 2 nA/cm2.

            "From cortical maps to the control of muscles. The equilibrium point (EP) class of motor control models is revisited from the point of view of an approach to motor planning based on interacting cortical maps. The weak points is identified in the assumption that the way for the brain to control a movement is to generate a series of equilibrium points along a specific trajectory, usually referred to as virtual trajectory. This is rejected, re-evaluating the role of the cerebellar circuitry as a mechanical computer which is able to perform sequence-in sequenceout computations thus taking care of the dynamic aspects of the movement (Braitenberg et al. 1996). A learning framework is outlined, which discriminates short-term from long-term learning and is capable to explain single-trial adaptation to loads. This is still an EP model but the role of muscle stiffness is not limited to load compensation (for which it is not efficient and/or sufficient): stiffness is crucial for learning, as regards measurements (the muscle as strain gauge) and generalization of the learned patterns. Thus, in the economy of our formulation of EP-cerebellar control, the problem is not to have enough stiffness in order to compensate dynamic forces due to unknown loads but to have enough proprioceptive information for learning an effective model of the load. The integration between cortical planning and cerebellar control is discussed. As an example, the EP-cerebellar model is compared with the feedback-error learning approach proposed by Kawato & Gomi (1992). © 1997 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.. 1997\n",

            "Photocell-Based Optofluidic Device for Clogging-Free Cell Transit Time Measurements. Measuring the transit time of a cell forced through a bottleneck is one of the most widely used techniques for the study of cell deformability in flow. It in turn provides an accessible and rapid way of obtaining crucial information regarding cell physiology. Many techniques are currently being investigated to reliably retrieve this time, but their translation to diagnostic-oriented devices is often hampered by their complexity, lack of robustness, and the bulky external equipment required. Herein, we demonstrate the benefits of coupling microfluidics with an optical method, like photocells, to measure the transit time. We exploit the femtosecond laser irradiation followed by chemical etching (FLICE) fabrication technique to build a monolithic 3D device capable of detecting cells flowing through a 3D non-deformable constriction which is fully buried in a fused silica substrate. We validated our chip by measuring the transit times of pristine breast cancer cells (MCF-7) and MCF-7 cells treated with Latrunculin A, a drug typically used to increase their deformability. A difference in transit times can be assessed without the need for complex external instrumentation and/or demanding computational efforts. The high throughput (4000–10,000 cells/min), ease of use, and clogging-free operation of our device bring this approach much closer to real scenarios.. 2024\n",

Concerning the emerging power-to-gas technologies, which are considered the most promising technology for seasonal renewable energy storage, Underground Hydrogen Storage (UHS) has gained attention in the last few years. For safe and efficient storage, possible hydrogen losses due to dissolution into the aquifer must be estimated accurately. Due to safety concerns, experimental measurements of hydrogen solubility in brine at reservoir conditions are limited. In this study, a PVT cell is used to characterize the solubility of hydrogen and its mixtures with methane in saline water/brine. The experiments were carried out at 45, 50, and 55°C and from 1 bar up to 500 bar, mimicking a significant range of possible reservoir conditions. Two brine samples representative of two different reservoirs were tested. Two mixtures of methane and hydrogen (10 mol% H2 and 50 mol% H2, respectively) were considered, along with pure hydrogen, to account for the presence of methane in the primary phase of hydrogen storage in a depleted gas reservoir. In the current paper, a comparison of the experimental results with literature models is provided. At the experiment conditions, the impact of the differences in the composition of the two analyzed brines as well as the impact of the analyzed range of temperatures was not significant. Conversely, a non-negligible variation in terms of the slope of the solubility curve was observed as a function of the gas mixture composition: the curve increased more steeply as the percentage of hydrogen reduced.. 2024\n",
            "Magnesium vs. sodium alginate as precursors of calcium alginate: Mechanical differences and advantages in the development of functional neuronal networks. Calcium alginate is one of the most widely employed matrices in regenerative medicine. A downside is its heterogeneity, due to the poorly controllable character of the gelation of sodium alginate (NaAlg), i.e. the commonly used alginate salt, with calcium. Here, we have used magnesium alginate (MgAlg) as an alternative precursor of calcium alginate. MgAlg coils, more compact and thus less entangled than those of NaAlg, allow for an easier diffusion of calcium ions, whereas Mg is exchanged with calcium more slowly than Na; this allows for the formation of a material (Ca(Mg)Alg) with a more reversible creep behaviour than Ca(Na)Alg, due to a more homogeneous – albeit lower - density of elastically active cross-links. We also show that Ca(Mg)Alg supports better than Ca(Na)Alg the network development and function of embedded (rat cortical) neurons: they show greater neurite extension and branching at 7 and 21 days (Tubb3 and Map2 immunofluorescence) and better neuronal network functional maturation / more robust and longer-lasting activity, probed by calcium imaging and microelectrode array electrophysiology. Overall, our results unveil the potential of MgAlg as bioactive biomaterial for enabling the formation of functional neuron-based tissue analogues.. 2024\n",
            "Differences in regional brain structure in toddlers with autism are related to future language outcomes. Language and social symptoms improve with age in some autistic toddlers, but not in others, and such outcome differences are not clearly predictable from clinical scores alone. Here we aim to identify early-age brain alterations in autism that are prognostic of future language ability. Leveraging 372 longitudinal structural MRI scans from 166 autistic toddlers and 109 typical toddlers and controlling for brain size, we find that, compared to typical toddlers, autistic toddlers show differentially larger or thicker temporal and fusiform regions; smaller or thinner inferior frontal lobe and midline structures; larger callosal subregion volume; and smaller cerebellum. Most differences are replicated in an independent cohort of 75 toddlers. These brain alterations improve accuracy for predicting language outcome at 6-month follow-up beyond intake clinical and demographic variables. Temporal, fusiform, and inferior frontal alterations are related to autism symptom severity and cognitive impairments at early intake ages. Among autistic toddlers, brain alterations in social, language and face processing areas enhance the prediction of the child’s future language ability.. 2024\n",
            "New Insight into the Fatigue Resistance of Photochromic 1,2-Diarylethenes. Photochromic diarylethenes represent one of the most important classes of molecular switches, and their fatigue resistance is reported in several papers. Previous studies have demonstrated that the presence of perfluorocyclopentene and methyl in the 4-positions of dithienylethenes improve the switching resistance. However, general guidelines to correlate chemical structure to fatigue resistance have not been found yet. In this work, we provide a different thought in the description of the fatigue resistance of diarylethenes, which is related to the light absorbed by the two isomeric states during photoconversion. For two series of 1,2-diarylethenes, which differ from the aromatic rings without bearing any electroactive substituent, it turns out that the fatigue resistance depends on the dose of light absorbed by the colored form rather than on the specific molecular structure, namely, the presence of specific molecular building blocks.. 2017\n",

Nanoporous (NP) gold, the most extensively studied and efficient NP metal, possesses exceptional properties that make it highly attractive for advanced technological applications. Notably, its remarkable catalytic properties in various significant reactions hold enormous potential. However, the exploration of its catalytic activity in the degradation of water pollutants remains limited. Nevertheless, previous research has reported the catalytic activity of NP Au in the degradation of methyl orange (MO), a toxic azo dye commonly found in water. This study aims to investigate the behavior of nanoporous gold in MO solutions using UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy and high-performance liquid chromatography. The NP Au was prepared by chemical removal of silver atoms of an AuAg precursor alloy prepared by ball milling. Immersion tests were conducted on both pellets and powders of NP Au, followed by examination of the residual solutions. Additionally, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and electrochemical impedance measurements were employed to analyze NP Au after the tests. The findings reveal that the predominant and faster process involves the partially reversible adsorption of MO onto NP Au, while the catalytic degradation of the dye plays a secondary and slower role in this system.. 2024\n",
            "Using reweighted pulling simulations to characterize conformational changes in riboswitches. Riboswitches are RNA sequences located in noncoding portions of mRNA that can sense specific ligands and subsequently control gene expression. The ligand-binding event induces conformational changes in the riboswitch that are then transmitted to the gene expression apparatus. Probing the mechanisms of such a fine regulation at atomic resolution is very difficult experimentally and molecular dynamics (MD) could be used to quantify the ligand-dependent behavior of a riboswitch. However, since the accessible time scale of fully atomistic simulations is limited, this can only be done using enhanced sampling techniques. Here, we discuss the application of steered MD to the characterization of the ligand-dependent stability of the aptamer terminal helix in the add adenine-sensing riboswitch. The employed techniques are discussed in detail and sample input files are provided. We show that with a limited computational effort it is possible to quantify, in terms of free energy, the stacking interaction between the ligand and the terminal helix, obtaining results in agreement with thermodynamic experiments.. 2015\n",
            "A regularized matrix factorization approach to induce structured sparse-low-rank solutions in the EEG inverse problem. We consider the estimation of the Brain Electrical Sources (BES) matrix from noisy electroencephalographic (EEG) measurements, commonly named as the EEG inverse problem. We propose a new method to induce neurophysiological meaningful solutions, which takes into account the smoothness, structured sparsity, and low rank of the BES matrix. The method is based on the factorization of the BES matrix as a product of a sparse coding matrix and a dense latent source matrix. The structured sparse-low-rank structure is enforced by minimizing a regularized functional that includes the l 21-norm of the coding matrix and the squared Frobenius norm of the latent source matrix. We develop an alternating optimization algorithm to solve the resulting nonsmooth-nonconvex minimization problem. We analyze the convergence of the optimization procedure, and we compare, under different synthetic scenarios, the performance of our method with respect to the Group Lasso and Trace Norm regularizers when they are applied directly to the target matrix. © 2014 Montoya-Martínez et al.; licensee Springer.. 2014\n",

            "Critical aspects in dissolution testing of nanomaterials in the oro-gastrointestinal tract: the relevance of juice composition for hazard identification and grouping. The dissolution of a nanomaterial (NM) in an in vitro simulant of the oro-gastrointestinal (OGI) tract is an important predictor of its biodurability in vivo. The cascade addition of simulated digestive juices (saliva, stomach and intestine), including inorganic/organic biomacromolecules and digestive enzymes (complete composition, referred to as “Type 1 formulation”), strives for realistic representation of chemical composition of the OGI tract. However, the data robustness requires consideration of analytical feasibility, such as the use of simplified media. Here we present a systematic analysis of the effects exerted by different digestive juice formulations on the dissolution% (or half-life values) of benchmark NMs (e.g., zinc oxide, titanium dioxide, barium sulfate, and silicon dioxide). The digestive juices were progressively simplified by removal of components such as organic molecules, enzymes, and inorganic molecules (Type 2, 3 and 4). The results indicate that the “Type 1 formulation” augments the dissolution via sequestration of ions by measurable factors compared to formulations without enzymes (i.e., Type 3 and 4). Type 1 formulation is thus regarded as a preferable option for predicting NM biodurability for hazard assessment. However, for grouping purposes, the relative similarity among diverse nanoforms (NFs) of a NM is decisive. Two similarity algorithms were applied, and additional case studies comprising NFs and non NFs of the same substance were included. The results support the grouping decision by simplified formulation (Type 3) as a robust method for screening and grouping purposes.. 2023\n",

            "A bilinear approach to the position self-calibration of multiple sensors. This paper presents a novel algorithm for the automatic 3D localization of a set of sensors in an unknown environment. Given the measures of a set of time of arrival delays at each sensor, the approach simultaneously estimates the 3D position of the sensors and the sources that have generated the event. Such inference is obtained with no assumption about the sensor localization; the only assumption made is that the emission time of the sources must be known in order to evaluate the time of flight for each event. Moreover, we propose a further method that deals with the likely case of missing data in the measurements. This occurs when sensors are far apart or behind natural barriers that avoids the registration of the given event. Simulated experiments show the validity of the approach for different setups of sensors and number of events. © 2011 IEEE.. 2012\n",

Twenty patients with clinically suspected breast cancer recurrence underwent MRI before and after paramagnetic contrast agent administration (MR mammography, MRM), after negative (4/20), questionable (11/20) or positive (5/20) X-ray mammography (XM). Spin-echo T1-weighted images before and after the i.v. administration of Gd-DTPA (0.15 mmol/kg) were acquired at 1, 3, 5, 7 and 10 minutes. Tissue behavior was studied directly on the images (qualitative analysis) and with dynamic curves of the signal-to-noise ratio and of enhancement rate (quantitative analysis). The histologic examination was performed in all cases--18 of them by surgical excision and in two by needle biopsy only. Seven of seven recurrences exhibited early (at 1 and 3 minutes) and focal qualitative enhancement, exceeding 100% at the quantitative analysis. Twelve of thirteen non-recurrences exhibited no significant qualitative enhancement, less than 40% at the quantitative analysis, while the extant lesion exhibited multifocal delayed (at 5-10 minutes) qualitative enhancement, about 60% at the quantitative analysis, and slight bilateral diffuse enhancement (proliferative dysplasia). MRM had 100% sensitivity, 92.3% specificity, 87.5% positive predictive value and 100% negative predictive value. XM had 100%, 30.8%, 43.7% and 100%, respectively (if we consider as positive all the questionable XM cases).

In vitro and in vivo studies in mouse models of Cdkl5 deficiency have highlighted the role of CDKL5 in brain development and, in particular, in the morphogenesis and synaptic connectivity of hippocampal and cortical neurons. Interestingly, Cdkl5 deficiency in mice increases vulnerability to excitotoxic stress in hippocampal neurons. However, the mechanism by which CDKL5 controls neuronal survival is far from being understood. To investigate further the function of CDKL5 and dissect the molecular mechanisms underlying neuronal survival, we generated a human neuronal model of CDKL5 deficiency, using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing. We demonstrated that CDKL5 deletion in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells not only impairs neuronal maturation but also reduces cell proliferation and survival, with alterations in the AKT and ERK signaling pathways and an increase in the proapoptotic BAX protein and in DNA damage-associated biomarkers (i.e., γH2AX, RAD50, and PARP1). Furthermore, CDKL5-deficient cells were hypersensitive to DNA damage-associated stress, accumulated more DNA damage foci (γH2AX positive) and were more prone to cell death than the controls. Importantly, increased kainic acid-induced cell death of hippocampal neurons of Cdkl5 KO mice correlated with an increased γH2AX immunostaining. The results suggest a previously unknown role for CDKL5 in DNA damage response that could underlie the pro-survival function of CDKL5.. 2020\n",
            "Optimizing Human–Robot Teaming Performance through Q-Learning-Based Task Load Adjustment and Physiological Data Analysis. The transition to Industry 4.0 and 5.0 underscores the need for integrating humans into manufacturing processes, shifting the focus towards customization and personalization rather than traditional mass production. However, human performance during task execution may vary. To ensure high human–robot teaming (HRT) performance, it is crucial to predict performance without negatively affecting task execution. Therefore, to predict performance indirectly, significant factors affecting human performance, such as engagement and task load (i.e., amount of cognitive, physical, and/or sensory resources required to perform a particular task), must be considered. Hence, we propose a framework to predict and maximize the HRT performance. For the prediction of task performance during the development phase, our methodology employs features extracted from physiological data as inputs. The labels for these predictions—categorized as accurate performance or inaccurate performance due to high/low task load—are meticulously crafted using a combination of the NASA TLX questionnaire, records of human performance in quality control tasks, and the application of Q-Learning to derive task-specific weights for the task load indices. This structured approach enables the deployment of our model to exclusively rely on physiological data for predicting performance, thereby achieving an accuracy rate of 95.45% in forecasting HRT performance. To maintain optimized HRT performance, this study further introduces a method of dynamically adjusting the robot’s speed in the case of low performance. This strategic adjustment is designed to effectively balance the task load, thereby enhancing the efficiency of human–robot collaboration.. 2024\n",
            "Lattice Boltzmann scheme for fluids with dynamic heterogeneities. We introduce and discuss a three-dimensional mesoscopic lattice Boltzmann model for the numerical simulation of strongly-interacting fluids with dynamic inhomogeneities. The model is based on an extension of the standard lattice Boltzmann dynamics in which streaming between neighboring lattice sites is constrained by the value of the nonlocal density of the surrounding fluid. The resulting dynamics exhibits typical features of dynamically heterogeneous fluids, such as long-time relaxation, non-Gaussian density distributions and dynamic heterogeneities. Due to its intrinsically parallel dynamics and absence of statistical noise, the method is expected to compute significantly faster than molecular dynamics, Monte Carlo, and lattice glass models. © 2006 The American Physical Society.. 2006\n",
            "Cortico-cortical transfer of socially derived information gates emotion recognition. Emotion recognition and the resulting responses are important for survival and social functioning. However, how socially derived information is processed for reliable emotion recognition is incompletely understood. Here, we reveal an evolutionarily conserved long-range inhibitory/excitatory brain network mediating these socio-cognitive processes. Anatomical tracing in mice revealed the existence of a subpopulation of somatostatin (SOM) GABAergic neurons projecting from the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) to the retrosplenial cortex (RSC). Through optogenetic manipulations and Ca2+ imaging fiber photometry in mice and functional imaging in humans, we demonstrate the specific participation of these long-range SOM projections from the mPFC to the RSC, and an excitatory feedback loop from the RSC to the mPFC, in emotion recognition. Notably, we show that mPFC-to-RSC SOM projections are dysfunctional in mouse models relevant to psychiatric vulnerability and can be targeted to rescue emotion recognition deficits in these mice. Our findings demonstrate a cortico-cortical circuit underlying emotion recognition.. 2024\n",
            "A longitudinal observational study in two cats naturally-infected with hepadnavirus. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a major cause of liver disease in humans including chronic hepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Domestic cat hepadnavirus (DCH), a novel HBV-like hepadnavirus, was identified in domestic cats in 2018. From 6.5 %–10.8 % of pet cats are viremic for DCH and altered serological markers suggestive of liver damage have been identified in 50 % of DCH-infected cats. DCH DNA has been detected in association with characteristic lesions of chronic hepatitis and with hepatocellular carcinoma in cats, suggesting a possible association. In this study longitudinal molecular screening of cats infected with DCH was performed to determine if DCH can cause chronic infections in cats. Upon re-testing of sera from five DCH-positive animals, 2–10 months after the initial diagnosis, three cats tested negative for DCH on two consecutive occasions using quantitative PCR. Two other cats remained DCH-positive, including an 8-month-old female cat re-tested four months after the initial positive result, and a 9-year-old male cat, which tested positive for DCH on six occasions over an 11-month period. The latter had a history of chronic hepatopathy with jaundice, lethargy and elevated serum alanine transaminase levels (ALT). During the period of observation, DCH titers ranged between 1.64 × 105 and 2.09 × 106 DNA copies/mL and ALT was persistently elevated, suggesting chronic infection. DCH DNA was not detected in oral, conjunctival, preputial and rectal swabs from the two animals collected at several time points. Long-term (chronic) infection would be consistent with the relatively high number of viremic cats identified in epidemiological investigations, with the possible association of DCH with chronic hepatic pathologies and with what described with HBV in human patients.. 2021\n",
            "Probing Interplays between Human XBP1u Translational Arrest Peptide and 80S Ribosome. The ribosome stalling mechanism is a crucial biological process, yet its atomistic underpinning is still elusive. In this framework, the human XBP1u translational arrest peptide (AP) plays a central role in regulating the unfolded protein response (UPR) in eukaryotic cells. Here, we report multimicrosecond all-atom molecular dynamics simulations designed to probe the interactions between the XBP1u AP and the mammalian ribosome exit tunnel, both for the wild type AP and for four mutant variants of different arrest potencies. Enhanced sampling simulations allow investigating the AP release process of the different variants, shedding light on this complex mechanism. The present outcomes are in qualitative/quantitative agreement with available experimental data. In conclusion, we provide an unprecedented atomistic picture of this biological process and clear-cut insights into the key AP-ribosome interactions.. 2022\n",
            "Ligandability and druggability assessment via machine learning. Drug discovery is a daunting and failure-prone task. A critical process in this research field is represented by the biological target and pocket identification steps as they heavily determine the subsequent efforts in selecting a putative ligand, most often a small molecule. Finding “ligandable” pockets, namely protein cavities that may accept a drug-like binder is instrumental to the more general and drug discovery oriented “druggability” estimation process. While high-throughput experimental techniques exist to identify putative binding sites other than the orthosteric one, these techniques are relatively expensive and not so commonly available in labs. In this regard, computational means of detecting ligandable pockets are advisable for their inexpensiveness and speed. These methods can become, in principle, particularly predictive when supported by machine learning methodologies that provide the modeling framework. As with any data-driven effort, the outcome critically depends on the input data, its featurization process and possible associated biases. Also, the machine learning task, (supervised/unsupervised) the learning method, and the possible usage of molecular dynamics data considerably shape the inherent assumptions of the modeling step. Defining a proper quantitative thermodynamic and/or kinetic score (or label) is key to the modeling process; here we revise literature and propose residence time as a novel ideal indicator of ligandability. Interestingly the vast majority of the methods does not keep into consideration kinetics nor thermodynamics when devising predictors.

            "Physics-informed deep neural network for image denoising. Image enhancement deep neural networks (DNN) can improve signal to noise ratio or resolution of optically collected visual information. The literature reports a variety of approaches with varying effectiveness. All these algorithms rely on arbitrary data (the pixels’ count-rate) normalization, making their performance strngly affected by dataset or user-specific data premanipulation. We developed a DNN algorithm capable to enhance images signal-to-noise surpassing previous algorithms. Our model stems from the nature of the photon detection process which is characterized by an inherently Poissonian statistics. Our algorithm is thus driven by distance between probability functions instead than relying on the sole count-rate, producing high performance results especially in high-dynamic-range images. Moreover, it does not require any arbitrary image renormalization other than the transformation of the camera’s count-rate into photon-number.. 2023\n",

            "Relevance of Ebola virus VP35 homo-dimerization on the type I interferon cascade inhibition. Ebola virus high lethality relies on its ability to efficiently bypass the host innate antiviral response, which senses the viral dsRNA through the RIG-I receptor and induces type I interferon α/β production. In the bypassing action, the Ebola virus protein VP35 plays a pivotal role at multiple levels of the RIG-I cascade, masking the viral 5′-triphosphorylated dsRNA from RIG-I, and interacting with other cascade components. The VP35 type I interferon inhibition is exerted by the C-terminal domain, while the N-terminal domain, containing a coiled-coil region, is primarily required for oligomerization. However, mutations at key VP35 residues L90/93/107A (VP35-3m) in the coiled-coil region were reported to affect oligomerization and reduce type I interferon antagonism, indicating a possible but unclear role of homo-oligomerization on VP35 interaction with the RIG-I pathway components. In this work, we investigated the VP35 dimerization thermodynamics and its contribution to type I interferon antagonism by computational and biological methods. Focusing on the coiled-coil region, we combined coarse-grained and all-atom simulations on wild type VP35 and VP35-3m homo-dimerization. According to our results, wild type VP35 coiled-coil is able to self-assemble into dimers, while VP35-3m coiled-coil shows poor propensity to even dimerize. Free-energy calculations confirmed the key role of L90, L93 and L107 in stabilizing the coiled-coil homo-dimeric structure. In vitro type I interferon antagonism studies, using full-length wild type VP35 and VP35-3m, revealed that VP35 homo-dimerization is an essential preliminary step for dsRNA binding, which appears to be the main factor of the VP35 RIG-I cascade inhibition, while it is not essential to block the other steps.. 2019\n",
            "Cutin from agro-waste as a raw material for the production of bioplastics. Cutin is the main component of plant cuticles constituting the framework that supports the rest of the cuticle components. This biopolymer is composed of esterified bi- and trifunctional fatty acids. Despite its ubiquity in terrestrial plants, it has been underutilized as raw material due to its insolubility and lack of melting point. However, in recent years, a few technologies have been developed to obtain cutin monomers from several agro-wastes at an industrial scale. This review is focused on the description of cutin properties, biodegradability, chemical composition, processability, abundance, and the state of art of the fabrication of cutin-based materials in order to evaluate whether this biopolymer can be considered a source for the production of renewable materials.. 2017\n",
            "A novel hepadnavirus in domestic dogs. Hepadnaviruses have been identified in several animal species. The hepadnavirus prototype, human hepatitis B virus (HBV), is a major public health problem associated with chronic liver diseases and hepatocellular carcinoma. Recently, a novel hepadnavirus, similar to HBV, was identified in domestic cats. Since several pathogens can be shared between cats and dogs, we hypothesized that dogs could also harbor hepadnaviruses and we tested a collection of canine sera with multiple molecular strategies. Overall, hepadnavirus DNA was identified in 6.3% (40/635) of canine serum samples, although the viral load in positive sera was low (geometric mean of 2.70 × 102 genome copies per mL, range min 1.36 × 102—max 4.03 × 104 genome copies per mL). On genome sequencing, the canine hepadnaviruses revealed high nucleotide identity (about 98%) and similar organization to the domestic cat hepadnavirus. Altered hepatic markers were found in hepadnavirus-positive dogs, although the role of hepadnavirus in canine health remains to be elucidated.. 2022\n",
            "Optically induced light modulation in an hybrid nanocomposite system of inorganic CdSe/CdS nanorods and nematic liquid crystals. We studied the thermo-optical properties and nonlinearities of new materials prepared in our labs which consisted in a nanocomposite blend of liquid crystals and semiconductor CdSe/CdS nanorods. We found a thermally induced optical bistability when a laser beam travelled across the cell, as the beam was able to cause a reversible switching in the optical properties of the blend from a scattering state to a transmissive state. The optically induced light modulation by a pump beam (Ar+ laser) was probed by a weak He-Ne beam when the two laser beams were incident on the cell simultaneously. The dependence of the hysteresis loop on the modulation frequency of the incident beam was also studied, and the variation in the light intensity was successfully exploited as a mean to switch the system from an opaque state to a transmission state, as it had a strong influence on the thermo-optical behaviour of the blend. Our results indicate a thermally- and optically induced light modulation, and demonstrate that the proposed system is promising for applications in thermo-optical switches. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

NiCo2S4 and CuCo2S4 have been proven to be effective electrode materials in energy storage applications. In this study we investigate the influence of polypyrrole on the electrochemical behavior of these two potential materials. At first, high surface area micro-sized hollow spheres of NiCo2S4 and CuCo2S4 were successfully synthesized through facile solvothermal method and then pyrrole was polymerized through oxidative polymerization on the surface of as-prepared spheres. Resuls demonstrate improved electrochemical performance of both NiCo2S4 and CuCo2S4 after composing with polypyrrole.

            "Biodegradable polylactic acid emulsion ink based on carbon nanotubes and silver for printed pressure sensors. Investigating biodegradable and biocompatible materials for electronic applications can lead to tangible outcomes such as developing green-electronic devices and reducing the amount of e-waste. The proposed emulsion-based conducting ink formulation takes into consideration circular economy and green principles throughout the entire process, from the selection of materials to the production process. The ink is formulated using the biopolymer polylactic acid dissolved in a sustainable solvent mixed with water, along with conductive carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and silver flakes as fillers. Hybrid conductive fillers can lower the percolation threshold of the ink and the production costs, while maintaining excellent electrical properties. The coating formed after the deposition of the ink, undergoes isothermal treatment at different temperatures and durations to improve its adhesion and electrical properties. The coating’s performance was evaluated by creating an eight-finger interdigitated sensor using a Voltera PCB printer. The sensor demonstrates exceptional performance when exposed to various loading and unloading pressures within the 0.2–500.0 kPa range. The results show a consistent correlation between the change in electrical resistance and the stress caused by the applied load. The ink is biodegradable in marine environments, which helps avoiding its accumulation in the ecosystem over time.. 2024\n",
            "GLUT4 defects in adipose tissue are early signs of metabolic alterations in alms1GT/GT, a mouse model for obesity and insulin resistance. Dysregulation of signaling pathways in adipose tissue leading to insulin resistance can contribute to the development of obesity-related metabolic disorders. Alström Syndrome, a recessive ciliopathy, caused by mutations in ALMS1, is characterized by progressive metabolic alterations such as childhood obesity, hyperinsulinemia, and type 2 diabetes. Here we investigated the role of Alms1 disruption in AT expansion and insulin responsiveness in a murine model for Alström Syndrome. A gene trap insertion in Alms1 on the insulin sensitive C57BL6/Ei genetic background leads to early hyperinsulinemia and a progressive increase in body weight. At 6 weeks of age, before the onset of the metabolic disease, the mutant mice had enlarged fat depots with hypertrophic adipocytes, but without signs of inflammation. Expression of lipogenic enzymes was increased. Pre-adipocytes isolated from mutant animals demonstrated normal adipogenic differentiation but gave rise to mature adipocytes with reduced insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. Assessment of whole body glucose homeostasis revealed glucose intolerance. Insulin stimulation resulted in proper AKT phosphorylation in adipose tissue. However, the total amount of glucose transporter 4 (SLC4A2) and its translocation to the plasma membrane were reduced in mutant adipose depots compared to wildtype littermates. Alterations in insulin stimulated trafficking of glucose transporter 4 are an early sign of metabolic dysfunction in Alström mutant mice, providing a possible explanation for the reduced glucose uptake and the compensatory hyperinsulinemia. The metabolic signaling deficits either reside downstream or are independent of AKT activation and suggest a role for ALMS1 in GLUT4 trafficking. Alström mutant mice represent an interesting model for the development of metabolic disease in which adipose tissue with a reduced glucose uptake can expand by de novo lipogenesis to an obese state.. 2014\n",

This study examines two separate things: (i) how guided and non-guided strategies affect blind individuals in encoding and mentally representing a trajectory and (ii) the sensory preferences for potential navigational aids through questionnaire-based research.

            "Underwater Quick-Hardening Vegetable Oil-Based Biodegradable Putty for Sustainable Coral Reef Restoration and Rehabilitation. Coral reefs are threatened by climate change and the effects of human activity on the marine environment. Researchers are attempting to rescue this fragile ecosystem through coral restoration actions, and a common step in these procedures is transplanting the new coral colonies into coral reefs. To do that, commercial concrete or epoxy resins, also called putty, are utilized, highlighting different concerns about their mechanical and hardening performances and their impact and fate once released into the environment. Hence, this study presents a new biodegradable epoxidized soybean oil acrylate (ESOA)/zein-based coral putty capable of quick hardening underwater as an ecofriendly alternative for transplantation of new coral colonies in the reef. Coral putty is composed of two components, containing one a radical initiator and the other a radical accelerator. Once the two components are mixed, coral putty becomes hard underwater in 20–25 min, showing a hardening timescale much faster than other commercial products. The coral putty is biocompatible when applied to the coral Stylophora pistillata in aquaria and Acropora tenuis corals are out-planted on the reef in the Maldives, demonstrating how this new class of vegetable-oil-based materials can be a more sustainable alternative to epoxy resins commonly used in coral restoration procedures.. 2024\n",

            "Investigation of transcription factor-DNA binding with electrolyte-gated organic transistors. Nuclear transcription factor Y (NF-Y) is a CCAAT-binding trimeric protein. The overexpression of the DNA-binding subunit A (NF-YA) results in deregulation of many CCAAT-dependent pro-growth genes in multiple tumor types. Exon 3 alternative splicing of NF-YA results in two different isoforms, NF-YAs (short) and NF-YAl (long), which can promote tumor proliferation or metastasis, respectively. In this work, we developed an electrolyte-gated organic transistor (EGOT) biosensor to study the binding of a NF-YAl-composed NF-Y complex to its consensus sequence. We show that by using the target DNA sequence as a probe, the device detects NF-Y in the range of 1 pM to 10 nM. Control experiments performed with oligonucleotide probes mutated in the consensus sequence exhibit weaker, though not fully hindered, binding to NF-Y compared to the response to unmutated DNA. This behavior confirms that the base pairs near the CCAAT-box also have a role in the transcription factor recognition. Furthermore, we contributed to the advancement of the present state of the art by demonstrating the ability of the EGOT biosensor to detect NF-Y in cell lysate, a fundamental step towards the development of point-of-care (POC) devices for the analysis of biopsies.. 2024\n",

For a complex autonomous robotic system such as a humanoid robot, motor-babbling-based sensorimotor learning is considered an effective method to develop an internal model of the self-body and the environment autonomously. However, learning process requires much time for exploration and computation. In this paper, we propose a method of sensorimotor learning which explores the learning domain actively. Our approach discovers that the embodied learning system can design its own learning process actively, which is different from the conventional passive data-access machine learning. The proposed model is characterized by a function we call the \"confidence\", and is a measure of the reliability of state control. The confidence for the state can be a good measure to bias the exploration strategy of data sampling, and to direct its attention to areas of learning interest. We consider the confidence function to be a first step toward an active behavior design for autonomous environment adaptation. The approach was experimentally validated in typical sensorimotor coordination such as arm reaching and object fixation, using the humanoid robot James and the iCub simulator. © 2009 IEEE.. 2009\n",
            "The mitochondrial protein Opa1 promotes adipocyte browning that is dependent on urea cycle metabolites. White to brown/beige adipocytes conversion is a possible therapeutic strategy to tackle the current obesity epidemics. While mitochondria are key for energy dissipation in brown fat, it is unknown if they can drive adipocyte browning. Here, we show that the mitochondrial cristae biogenesis protein optic atrophy 1 (Opa1) facilitates cell-autonomous adipocyte browning. In two cohorts of patients with obesity, including weight discordant monozygotic twin pairs, adipose tissue OPA1 levels are reduced. In the mouse, Opa1 overexpression favours white adipose tissue expandability as well as browning, ultimately improving glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity. Transcriptomics and metabolomics analyses identify the Jumanji family chromatin remodelling protein Kdm3a and urea cycle metabolites, including fumarate, as effectors of Opa1-dependent browning. Mechanistically, the higher cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels in Opa1 pre-adipocytes activate cAMP-responsive element binding protein (CREB), which transcribes urea cycle enzymes. Flux analyses in pre-adipocytes indicate that Opa1-dependent fumarate accumulation depends on the urea cycle. Conversely, adipocyte-specific Opa1 deletion curtails urea cycle and beige differentiation of pre-adipocytes, and is rescued by fumarate supplementation. Thus, the urea cycle links the mitochondrial dynamics protein Opa1 to white adipocyte browning.. 2021\n",
            "Towards Minimal Intervention Control with Competing Constraints. As many imitation learning algorithms focus on pure trajectory generation in either Cartesian space or joint space, the problem of considering competing trajectory constraints from both spaces still presents several challenges. In particular, when perturbations are applied to the robot, the underlying controller should take into account the importance of each space for the task execution, and compute the control effort accordingly. However, no such controller formulation exists. In this paper, we provide a minimal intervention control strategy that simultaneously addresses the problems of optimal control and competing constraints between Cartesian and joint spaces. In light of the inconsistency between Cartesian and joint constraints, we exploit the robot null space from an informationtheory perspective so as to reduce the corresponding conflict. An optimal solution to the aforementioned controller is derived and furthermore a connection to the classical finite horizon linear quadratic regulator (LQR) is provided. Finally, a writing task in a simulated robot verifies the effectiveness of our approach.. 2018\n",
            "CK2 modulates adipocyte insulin-signaling and is up-regulated in human obesity. Insulin plays a major role in glucose metabolism and insulin-signaling defects are present in obesity and diabetes. CK2 is a pleiotropic protein kinase implicated in fundamental cellular pathways and abnormally elevated in tumors. Here we report that in human and murine adipocytes CK2-inhibition decreases the insulin-induced glucose-uptake by counteracting Akt-signaling and GLUT4-translocation to the plasma membrane. In mice CK2 acts on insulin-signaling in adipose tissue, liver and skeletal muscle and its acute inhibition impairs glucose tolerance. Notably, CK2 protein-level and activity are greatly up-regulated in white adipose tissue from ob/ob and db/db mice as well as from obese patients, regardless the severity of their insulin-resistance and the presence of pre-diabetes or overt type 2 diabetes. Weight loss obtained by both bariatric surgery or hypocaloric diet reverts CK2 hyper-activation to normal level. Our data suggest a central role of CK2 in insulin-sensitivity, glucose homeostasis and adipose tissue remodeling. CK2 up-regulation is identified as a hallmark of adipose tissue pathological expansion, suggesting a new potential therapeutic target for human obesity.. 2017\n",

            "The motor system resonates to the distal goal of observed actions: Testing the inverse pliers paradigm in an ecological setting. Does motor mirroring in humans reflect the observed movements or the goal of the observed motor acts? Tools that dissociate the agent/object dynamics from the movements of the body parts used to operate them provide a model for testing resonance to both movements and goals. Here, we describe the temporal relationship of the observer's motor excitability, assessed with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), with the observed goal-directed tool actions, in an ecological setting. Motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) to TMS were recorded from the opponens pollicis (OP, thumb flexor) and the extensor indicis proprius (EIP, index extensor) muscles of participants while they observed a person moving several small objects with a pair of normal pliers (closed by finger flexion) or reverse pliers (opened by finger flexion). The MEPs were a significant predictor of the pliers' kinematics that occurred in a variable time interval between -400 and +300 ms from TMS. Whatever pliers' type was being observed, OP MEPs correlated positively and EIP MEPs correlated negatively with the velocity of pliers' tips closure. This datum was confirmed both at individual and at a group level. Motor simulation can be demonstrated in single observers in a \"real-life\" ecological setting. The relation of motor resonance to the tool type shows that the observer's motor system codes the distal goal of the observed acts (i.e., grasping and releasing objects) in terms of its own motor vocabulary, irrespective of the actual finger movements that were performed by the observed actor. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.. 2013\n",
            "Metal-enhanced Förster resonance energy transfer (ME-FRET) in anthracene/tetracene-doped crystal systems. Anthracene tetracene-doped crystals (TA) dispersed in a thin polymer film matrix have been reported as efficient down converting systems based on Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) which occurs efficiently from donor (anthracene) to acceptor (tetracene) molecules. In this work, we demonstrate that the efficiency of this system can be further improved by a metal-enhanced FRET, which is obtained by incorporating metal nanoparticles into the polymer matrix. We report on the preparation and optical responses of polymeric transparent thin films where dodecanethiol-capped silver or gold nanoparticles are dispersed with TA in a polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) matrix. A maximum of 11-fold and 6.5-fold enhancement was achieved with silver and gold nanoparticles, respectively. Efficiency is discussed in terms of film morphology and plasmon resonance induced effects.. 2017\n",
            "Purified and oxidized single-walled carbon nanotubes as robust near-IR fluorescent probes for molecular imaging. Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) are suitable for many applications in molecular imaging because of their intrinsic near-infrared (NIR) photoluminescence. Nevertheless, several important issues, such as the SWNTs low biocompatibility, still need to be overcome for the effective use of carbon nanotubes in molecular imaging. In this study, we employ a two-step oxidation procedure with the aims of (1) removing the toxic metal impurities, (2) decreasing the lengths of the tubes, and (3) introducing functional oxygenated groups on the SWNT surface to enable the future development of a multifunctional SWNT-based nanoplatform. Since the presence of defect sites on the SWNT surface is known to quench the optical properties of carbon nanotubes, we have established what effect these two chemical treatments have on the NIR photoluminescence (PL) of the tubes. Our results show that purified and oxidized SWNT samples still display structured emission features in the NIR when dispersed in surfactant aqueous solution, with a residual emission efficiency of 30%. Two-dimensional (2D) fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) of aggregates of purified and oxidized SWNTs in dimethylformamide (DMF) showed an average lifetime of 1.3 and 1.2 ns, respectively. These results demonstrate the relevance of SWNT purification and oxidation in the development of novel NIR probes with reduced toxicological impact on human health and with potential for further functionalization with multiple bioactive species. © 2010 American Chemical Society.. 2010\n",

            "Automatic digital hologram denoising by spatiotemporal analysis of pixel-wise statistics. In this paper, a new technique to reduce the noise in a reconstructed hologram image is proposed. Unlike all the techniques in the literature, the proposed approach not only takes into account spatial information but also temporal statistics associated with the pixels. This innovative solution enables, at first, the automatic detection of the areas of the image containing the objects (foreground). This way, all the pixels not belonging to any objects are directly cleaned up and the contrast between objects and background is consistently increased. The remaining pixels are then processed with a spatio-temporal filtering which cancels out the effects of speckle noise, while preserving the structural details of the objects. The proposed approach has been compared with other common speckle denoising techniques and it is found to give better both visual and quantitative results. © 2013 IEEE.. 2013\n",
            "Mice overexpressing lamin B1 in oligodendrocytes recapitulate the age-dependent motor signs, but not the early autonomic cardiovascular dysfunction of autosomal-dominant leukodystrophy (ADLD). Autosomal dominant leukodystrophy (ADLD) is a rare adult-onset demyelinating disease caused by overexpression of lamin B1, a nuclear lamina filament. Early autonomic dysfunction involving the cardiovascular system before progressive somatic motor dysfunction is a striking feature of most cases of ADLD. In the Plp-FLAG-LMNB1 transgenic mouse model, lamin B1 overexpression in oligodendrocytes elicits somatic motor dysfunction and neuropathology akin to ADLD. Here, we investigate whether Plp-FLAG-LMNB1 mice also develop autonomic cardiovascular dysfunction before or after somatic motor dysfunction. We find that Plp-FLAG-LMNB1 mice have preserved cardiovascular responses to changes in wake-sleep state and ambient temperature and normal indexes of autonomic modulation at 37–42 weeks of age despite a progressive somatic motor dysfunction, which includes impairments of walking ability (the ability to walk on a narrow path was impaired in 80% of mice at 34–38 weeks of age) and subtle breathing derangements. Only late in the development of the disease phenotype did Plp-FLAG-LMNB1 mice develop a structural deficit of sympathetic noradrenergic fibers, with a 38% decrease in fiber profiles in the kidneys at 44–47 weeks of age. We demonstrate that while the Plp-FLAG-LMNB1 mouse model recapitulates the age-dependent motor dysfunction of ADLD, it does not show signs of early autonomic cardiovascular dysfunction, raising the possibility that oligodendrocyte dysfunction may not be sufficient to cause the full spectrum of clinical features present in ADLD.. 2018\n",
            "Exploring the Link Between Sensory Processing and Psychopathology in a Community Sample of Young Adults: Bayesian Network Analyses. Sensory processing is a fundamental aspect of human experience, and varies significantly between individuals, potentially affecting individual functioning, behaviour, and mental health. This study investigated the associations between sensory processing and psychopathology in a sample of the general population. Participants responded to a general psychiatric screening tool (DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure-Adult) and to the Adolescent/Adult Sensory Profile (AASP) questionnaire. The sample comprised 1108 young adults (77.25% females, mean age 22.6). Data were analysed using item response theory and Bayesian network analyses, revealing specific associations between sensory profiles and psychopathological dimensions. Specifically, we detected associations between the low registration sensory profile and the dimensions of psychosis, substance use, and mania. Sensation seeking was associated with mania. Sensory sensitivity was related to depression and mania, while sensation avoiding was inversely correlated with mania. These findings suggest that reduced external sensory awareness may be linked to a predisposition to psychosis, while a multifaceted sensory processing pattern may indicate vulnerability to mood disorders. Assessing sensory processing could yield crucial insights into individual susceptibilities to mental disorders and help identify targeted preventive and therapeutic strategies. 2024\n",
            "Coppercoresilvershell nanoparticle-yolk/shell Fe 3O4@chitosan-derived carbon nanoparticle composite as an efficient catalyst for catalytic epoxidation in water. The fabrication of yolk/shell spheres consisting of a movable magnetic core and a chitosan-derived porous carbon shell, and plenty of tiny copper coresilvershell nanoparticles confined within the porous shell, is reported. Fe3O4 nanoclusters were first synthesized through a solvothermal method and then SiO2 shell was coated on the Fe3O4 surface via a sol-gel process. Subsequently, chitosan was used to modify the surface of Fe3O 4@SiO2. Then, selective etching of the middle SiO 2 layer was accomplished to obtain the yolk/shell Fe 3O4@chitosan composites. Material consisting of coppercoresilvershell nanoparticles immobilized on each yolk/shell Fe3O4@chitosan-derived carbon nanoparticle could be synthesized starting with coppercoresilvershell nanoparticle-yolk/shell Fe3O4@chitosan composite; this is possible due to the well-known strong affinity of chitosan for transition metals. The ensuing catalyst was employed for the epoxidation reaction in aqueous media at ambient temperature. The products were obtained in high yields with the use of low amounts of the catalyst.

            "Enhancing human–robot collaborative transportation through obstacle-aware vibrotactile warning and virtual fixtures. Transporting large and heavy objects can benefit from Human–Robot Collaboration (HRC), increasing the contribution of robots to our daily tasks and addressing challenges arising from labor shortages. This strategy typically positions the human collaborator as the leader, with the robot assuming the follower role. However, when transporting large objects, the operator's situational awareness can be compromised as the objects may occlude different parts of the environment, weakening the human leader's decision-making capacity and leading to failure due to collision. This paper proposes a situational awareness framework for collaborative transportation to face this challenge. The framework integrates a multi-modal haptic-based Obstacle Feedback Module with two units. The first unit consists of a warning module that alerts the operator through a haptic belt with four vibrotactile devices that provide feedback about the location and proximity of the obstacles. The second unit implements virtual fixtures as hard constraints for mobility. The warning feedback and the virtual fixtures act online based on the information given by two Lidars mounted on a mobile manipulator to detect the obstacles in the surroundings. By enhancing the operator's awareness of the environment, the proposed module improves the safety of the human–robot team in collaborative transportation scenarios by preventing collisions. Experiments with 16 non-expert subjects in four feedback modalities during four scenarios report an objective evaluation thanks to quantitative metrics and subjective evaluations based on user-level experiences. The results reveal the strengths and weaknesses of the implemented feedback modalities while providing solid evidence of the increased situational awareness of the operator when the two haptic units are employed.. 2024\n",
            "Comparative study of loading of anodic porous alumina with silver nanoparticles using different methods. Three different routes were used to infiltrate the pores of anodic porous alumina templates with silver nanoparticles, selected as an example of a bioactive agent. The three methods present a continuous grading from more physical to more chemical character, starting from ex situ filling of the pores with pre-existing particles, moving on to in situ formation of particles in the pores by bare calcination and ending with in situ calcination following specific chemical reactions. The resulting presence of silver inside the pores was assessed by means of energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction. The number and the size of nanoparticles were evaluated by scanning electron microscopy of functionalized alumina cross-sections, followed by image analysis. It appears that the best functionalization results are obtained with the in situ chemical procedure, based on the prior formation of silver ion complex by means of ammonia, followed by reduction with an excess amount of acetaldehyde. Elution of the silver content from the chemically functionalized alumina into phosphate buffer saline has also been examined, demonstrating a sustained release of silver over time, up to 15 h. © 2013 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.. 2013\n",
            "Dysfunction of the serotonergic system in the brain of synapsin triple knockout mice is associated with behavioral abnormalities resembling synapsin-related human pathologies. Synapsins (Syns) are a family of phosphoproteins associated with synaptic vesicles (SVs). Their main function is to regulate neurotransmitter release by maintaining a reserve pool of SVs at the presynaptic terminal. Previous studies reported that the deletion of one or more Syn genes in mice results in an epileptic phenotype and autism-related behavioral abnormalities. Here we aimed at characterizing the behavioral phenotype and neurobiological correlates of the deletion of Syns in a Syn triple knockout (TKO) mouse model. Wild type (WT) and TKO mice were tested in the open field, novelty suppressed feeding, light-dark box, forced swim, tail suspension and three-chamber sociability tests. Using in vivo electrophysiology, we recorded the spontaneous activity of dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) serotonin (5-HT) and ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine (DA) neurons. Levels of 5-HT and DA in the frontal cortex and hippocampus of WT and TKO mice were also assessed using a High-Performance Liquid Chromatography. TKO mice displayed hyperactivity and impaired social and anxiety-like behavior. Behavioral dysfunctions were accompanied by reduced firing activity of DRN 5-HT, but not VTA DA, neurons. TKO mice also showed increased responsiveness of DRN 5-HT-1A autoreceptors, measured as a reduced dose of the 5-HT-1A agonist 8-OH-DPAT necessary to inhibit DRN 5-HT firing activity by 50%. Finally, hippocampal 5-HT levels were lower in TKO than in WT mice. Overall, Syns deletion in mice leads to a reduction in DRN 5-HT firing activity and hippocampal 5-HT levels along with behavioral alterations reminiscent of human neuropsychiatric conditions associated with Syn dysfunction.. 2021\n",

            "An important role for N-acylethanolamine acid amidase in the complete freund's adjuvant rat model of arthritis. The endogenous lipid amides, palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) and oleoylethanolamide (OEA), exert marked antinociceptive and anti-inflammatory effects in animal models by engaging nuclear peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-a. PEA and OEA are produced by macrophages and other host-defense cells and are deactivated by the cysteine amidase, N-acylethanolamine acid amidase (NAAA), which is highly expressed in macrophages and B-lymphocytes. In the present study, we examined whether a) NAAA might be involved in the inflammatory reaction triggered by injection of complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) into the rat paw and b) administration of 4-cyclohexylbutyl-N-[(S)-2-oxoazetidin- 3-yl]-carbamate (ARN726), a novel systemically active NAAA inhibitor, attenuates such reaction. Injection of CFA into the paw produced local edema and heat hyperalgesia, which were accompanied by decreased PEA and OEA content (assessed by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry) and increased NAAA levels (assessed by Western blot and ex vivo enzyme activity measurements) in paw tissue. Administration of undec- 10-ynyl-N-[(3S)-2-oxoazetidin-3-yl] carbamate (ARN14686), a NAAA-preferring activity-based probe, revealed that NAAA was catalytically active in CFA-treated paws. Administration of ARN726 reduced NAAA activity and restored PEA and OEA levels in inflamed tissues, and significantly decreased CFAinduced inflammatory symptoms, including pus production and myeloperoxidase activity. The results confirm the usefulness of ARN726 as a probe to investigate the functions of NAAA in health and disease and suggest that this enzyme may provide a new molecular target for the treatment of arthritis.. 2016\n",
            "Enhance chemotherapy efficacy and minimize anticancer drug side effects by using reversibly pH- and redox-responsive cross-linked unimolecular micelles. Chemotherapy side effects elimination while keeping the original therapeutic advantages has been of extensive interest over last decades. We herein develope a new pH and redox-sensitive nanogel for glutathione-mediated intracellular drug delivery employing disulfide crosselinked unimolecular micelles. We developed H40-polycaprolactone-b-polyacrylic acid-b′-methoxy poly(ethylene glycol)/poly(ethylene glycol)-folate (i.e., H40-PCL-(b-PAA-b′-MPEG/PEG-FA)2) unimolecular micelles with targeting moieties on the periphery. It was then crosslinked with cystamine in order to generate a pH and redox-sensitive nanogel. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) was performed to study pH-dependent nanogel sizes. We applied Paclitaxel, a hydrophobic anticancer drug, into delivery system and examined triggered release behaviors at different pHs upon DTT buffer exposure. Our results demonstrated that DTT presence as reductive agent within acidic environment is essential for drug release. This may potentially reduce unwanted drug release at non-cancerous acidic tissues leading to eliminated side effects. We examined biocompatibility and cytotoxicity of free nanogel and PTX-loaded nanogel to normal and cancer HeLa cells using MTT assay. Nanogel HeLa cell uptake was confirmed by Fluorescein loading into the gel followed by fluorescent microscope imaging. Our novel strategy would have profound implications in both enhanced chemotherapy efficacy and minimized side effects.. 2017\n",

            "A novel methodology to estimate metabolic flux distributions in constraint-based models. Quite generally, constraint-based metabolic flux analysis describes the space of viable flux configurations for a metabolic network as a high-dimensional polytope defined by the linear constraints that enforce the balancing of production and consumption fluxes for each chemical species in the system. In some cases, the complexity of the solution space can be reduced by performing an additional optimization, while in other cases, knowing the range of variability of fluxes over the polytope provides a sufficient characterization of the allowed configurations. There are cases, however, in which the thorough information encoded in the individual distributions of viable fluxes over the polytope is required. Obtaining such distributions is known to be a highly challenging computational task when the dimensionality of the polytope is sufficiently large, and the problem of developing cost-effective ad hoc algorithms has recently seen a major surge of interest. Here, we propose a method that allows us to perform the required computation heuristically in a time scaling linearly with the number of reactions in the network, overcoming some limitations of similar techniques employed in recent years. As a case study, we apply it to the analysis of the human red blood cell metabolic network, whose solution space can be sampled by different exact techniques, like Hit-and-Run Monte Carlo (scaling roughly like the third power of the system size). Remarkably accurate estimates for the true distributions of viable reaction fluxes are obtained, suggesting that, although further improvements are desirable, our method enhances our ability to analyze the space of allowed configurations for large biochemical reaction networks. © 2013 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.. 2013\n",
            "Remotely Controlled 3D-Engineered Scaffolds for Biomimetic In Vitro Investigations on Brain Cell Cocultures. Most in vitro studies regarding new anticancer treatments are performed on 2D cultures, despite this approach imposes several limitations in recapitulating the real tumor behavior and in predicting the effects of therapy on both cancer and healthy tissues. Herein, advanced in vitro models based on scaffolds that support the 3D growth of glioma cells, further allowing the cocultures with healthy brain cells, are presented. These scaffolds, doped with superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles and obtained through 2-photon polymerization, can be remotely manipulated thanks to an external magnet, thus obtaining biomimetic 3D organization recapitulating the brain cancer microenvironment. From a geometric point of view, the structure is functional to both cell culture on individual unit scaffolds and to tailored cocultures fostered by magnetic-driven unit assembly, also allowing for cell migration thanks to passages/fenestrations on adjacent structures. Leveraging magnetic dragging, for which a mathematical model is introduced, multiple cocultures are achieved, highlighting the high versatility and the user-friendly character of the proposed platform that can help overcome the current challenges in 3D cocultures handling, and open the way to the construction of increasingly biomimetic artificial systems.. 2024\n",

            "Adopting the intentional stance toward natural and artificial agents. In our daily lives, we need to predict and understand others’ behavior in order to navigate through our social environment. Predictions concerning other humans’ behavior usually refer to their mental states, such as beliefs or intentions. Such a predictive strategy is called ‘adoption of the intentional stance.’ In this paper, we review literature related to the concept of intentional stance from the perspectives of philosophy, psychology, human development, culture, and human-robot interaction. We propose that adopting the intentional stance might be a pivotal factor in facilitating social attunement with artificial agents. The paper first reviews the theoretical considerations regarding the intentional stance and examines literature related to the development of the intentional stance across life span. Subsequently, we discuss cultural norms as grounded in the intentional stance, and finally, we focus on the issue of adopting the intentional stance toward artificial agents, such as humanoid robots. At the dawn of the artificial intelligence era, the question of how–and also when–we predict and explain robots’ behavior by referring to mental states is of high interest. The paper concludes with a discussion on ethical consequences of adopting the intentional stance toward robots, and sketches future directions in research on this topic.. 2020\n",

            "c-Jun N-terminal kinase has a key role in Alzheimer disease synaptic dysfunction in vivo.. Altered synaptic function is considered one of the first features of Alzheimer disease (AD). Currently, no treatment is available to prevent the dysfunction of excitatory synapses in AD. Identification of the key modulators of synaptopathy is of particular significance in the treatment of AD. We here characterized the pathways leading to synaptopathy in TgCRND8 mice and showed that c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) is activated at the spine prior to the onset of cognitive impairment. The specific inhibition of JNK, with its specific inhibiting peptide D-JNKI1, prevented synaptic dysfunction in TgCRND8 mice. D-JNKI1 avoided both the loss of postsynaptic proteins and glutamate receptors from the postsynaptic density and the reduction in size of excitatory synapses, reverting their dysfunction. This set of data reveals that JNK is a key signaling pathway in AD synaptic injury and that its specific inhibition offers an innovative therapeutic strategy to prevent spine degeneration in AD.. 2014\n",

The problem of Eu incorporation into silica as dispersed dopants, clusters, separate-phase nanoparticles, or nanocrystals, which is of key importance for applications in the fields of lasers and scintillators, is faced by applying to sol-gel silica doped with nine different Eu3+ concentrations (0.001-10 mol % range) various spectroscopic techniques, including crystal field and vibrational mode analysis by means of Fourier transform absorption and microreflectivity (in the 200-6000 cm-1 and 9-300 K ranges), radioluminescence, and Raman scattering studies at 300 K. The variety of methods revealed the following concordant results: (1) amorphous Eu clusters grow when the Eu concentration is increased up to 3 mol % and (2) Si-OH groups are completely removed and ordered phase separation occurs at 10 mol % doping, as suggested by the remarkable narrowing of the spectral lines. Comparison with polycrystalline Eu oxide, Eu silicates, and α-quartz spectra allowed the unequivocal identification of Eu2Si2O7 pyrosilicate and α-quartz as the main components of nanocrystals in 10 mol % Eu-doped silica.

            "JNK contributes to Hif-1α regulation in hypoxic neurons. Hypoxia is an established factor of neurodegeneration. Nowadays, attention is directed at understanding how alterations in the expression of stress-related signaling proteins contribute to age dependent neuronal vulnerability to injury. The purpose of this study was to investigate how Hif-1α, a major neuroprotective factor, and JNK signaling, a key pathway in neurodegeneration, relate to hypoxic injury in young (6DIV) and adult (12DIV) neurons. We could show that in young neurons as compared to mature ones, the protective factor Hif-1α is more induced while the stress protein phospho-JNK displays lower basal levels. Indeed, changes in the expression levels of these proteins correlated with increased vulnerability of adult neurons to hypoxic injury. Furthermore, we describe for the first time that treatment with the D-JNKI1, a JNK-inhibiting peptide, rescues adult hypoxic neurons from death and contributes to Hif-1α upregulation, probably via a direct interaction with the Hif-1α protein.. 2010\n",
            "TRPV1 channels are critical brain inflammation detectors and neuropathic pain biomarkers in mice. The capsaicin receptor TRPV1 has been widely characterized in the sensory system as a key component of pain and inflammation. A large amount of evidence shows that TRPV1 is also functional in the brain although its role is still debated. Here we report that TRPV1 is highly expressed in microglial cells rather than neurons of the anterior cingulate cortex and other brain areas. We found that stimulation of microglial TRPV1 controls cortical microglia activation per se and indirectly enhances glutamatergic transmission in neurons by promoting extracellular microglial microvesicles shedding. Conversely, in the cortex of mice suffering from neuropathic pain, TRPV1 is also present in neurons affecting their intrinsic electrical properties and synaptic strength. Altogether, these findings identify brain TRPV1 as potential detector of harmful stimuli and a key player of microglia to neuron communication.. 2017\n",

            "CDC42 switches IRSp53 from inhibition of actin growth to elongation by clustering of VASP. Filopodia explore the environment, sensing soluble and mechanical cues during directional motility and tissue morphogenesis. How filopodia are initiated and spatially restricted to specific sites on the plasma membrane is still unclear. Here, we show that the membrane deforming and curvature sensing IRSp53 (Insulin Receptor Substrate of 53 kDa) protein slows down actin filament barbed end growth. This inhibition is relieved by CDC42 and counteracted by VASP, which also binds to IRSp53. The VASP:IRSp53 interaction is regulated by activated CDC42 and promotes high-density clustering of VASP, which is required for processive actin filament elongation. The interaction also mediates VASP recruitment to liposomes. In cells, IRSp53 and VASP accumulate at discrete foci at the leading edge, where filopodia are initiated. Genetic removal of IRSp53 impairs the formation of VASP foci, filopodia and chemotactic motility, while IRSp53 null mice display defective wound healing. Thus, IRSp53 dampens barbed end growth. CDC42 activation inhibits this activity and promotes IRSp53-dependent recruitment and clustering of VASP to drive actin assembly. These events result in spatial restriction of VASP filament elongation for initiation of filopodia during cell migration, invasion, and tissue repair. © 2013 European Molecular Biology Organization.. 2013\n",

            "Separating burst from background spikes in multichannel neuronal recordings using return map analysis. We propose a preprocessing method to separate coherent neuronal network activity, referred to as \"bursts\", from background spikes. High background activity in neuronal recordings reduces the effectiveness of currently available burst detection methods. For long-term, stationary recordings, burst and background spikes have a bimodal ISI distribution which makes it easy to select the threshold to separate burst and background spikes. Finite, nonstationary recordings lead to noisy ISIs for which the bimodality is not that clear. We introduce a preprocessing method to separate burst from background spikes to improve burst detection reliability because it efficiently uses both single and multichannel activity. The method is tested using a stochastic model constrained by data available in the literature and recordings from primary cortical neurons cultured on multielectrode arrays. The separation between burst and background spikes is obtained using the interspike interval return map. The cutoff threshold is the key parameter to separate the burst and background spikes. We compare two methods for selecting the threshold. (1) The 2-step method, in which threshold selection is based on fixed heuristics.

The proposed preprocessing method significantly increases the reliability of several established burst detection algorithms, both for simulated and real recordings. The preprocessing method makes it possible to study the effects of diseases or pharmacological manipulations, because it can deal efficiently with nonstationarity in the data. © 2014 World Scientific Publishing Company.. 2014\n",
            "Small Molecules Targeting DNA Polymerase Theta (POLθ) as Promising Synthetic Lethal Agents for Precision Cancer Therapy. Synthetic lethality (SL) is an innovative strategy in targeted anticancer therapy that exploits tumor genetic vulnerabilities. This topic has come to the forefront in recent years, as witnessed by the increased number of publications since 2007. The first proof of concept for the effectiveness of SL was provided by the approval of poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase inhibitors, which exploit a SL interaction in BRCA-deficient cells, although their use is limited by resistance. Searching for additional SL interactions involving BRCA mutations, the DNA polymerase theta (POLθ) emerged as an exciting target. This review summarizes, for the first time, the POLθ polymerase and helicase inhibitors reported to date. Compounds are described focusing on chemical structure and biological activity. With the aim to enable further drug discovery efforts in interrogating POLθ as a target, we propose a plausible pharmacophore model for POLθ-pol inhibitors and provide a structural analysis of the known POLθ ligand binding sites.. 2023\n",

            "A multi-channel low-power system-on-chip for in Vivo recording and wireless transmission of neural spikes. This paper reports a multi-channel neural spike recording system-on-chip with digital data compression and wireless telemetry. The circuit consists of 16 amplifiers, an analog time-division multiplexer, a single 8 bit analog-to-digital converter, a digital signal compression unit and a wireless transmitter. Although only 16 amplifiers are integrated in our current die version, the whole system is designed to work with 64, demonstrating the feasibility of a digital processing and narrowband wireless transmission of 64 neural recording channels. Compression of the raw data is achieved by detecting the action potentials (APs) and storing 20 samples for each spike waveform. This compression method retains sufficiently high data quality to allow for single neuron identification (spike sorting). The 400 MHz transmitter employs a Manchester-Coded Frequency Shift Keying (MC-FSK) modulator with low modulation index. In this way, a 1:25 Mbit/s data rate is delivered within a limited band of about 3 MHz. The chip is realized in a 0:35 μm AMS CMOS process featuring a 3 V power supply with an area of 3:1 x 2:7 mm2. The achieved transmission range is over 10 m with an overall power consumption for 64 channels of 17:2 mW. This figure translates into a power budget of 269 μW per channel, in line with published results but allowing a larger transmission distance and more efficient bandwidth occupation of the wireless link. The integrated circuit was mounted on a small and light board to be used during neuroscience experiments with freely-behaving rats. Powered by 2 AAA batteries, the system can continuously work for more than 100 hours allowing for long-lasting neural spike recordings. © 2012 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.. 2012\n",
            "Reciprocal cortico-amygdala connections regulate prosocial and selfish choices in mice. Decisions that favor one’s own interest versus the interest of another individual depend on context and the relationships between individuals. The neurobiology underlying selfish choices or choices that benefit others is not understood. We developed a two-choice social decision-making task in which mice can decide whether to share a reward with their conspecifics. Preference for altruistic choices was modulated by familiarity, sex, social contact, hunger, hierarchical status and emotional state matching. Fiber photometry recordings and chemogenetic manipulations demonstrated that basolateral amygdala (BLA) neurons are involved in the establishment of prosocial decisions. In particular, BLA neurons projecting to the prelimbic (PL) region of the prefrontal cortex mediated the development of a preference for altruistic choices, whereas PL projections to the BLA modulated self-interest motives for decision-making. This provides a neurobiological model of altruistic and selfish choices with relevance to pathologies associated with dysfunctions in social decision-making.. 2022\n",
            "Enhancing the resolution of STED microscopy by SPLIT and flimGANE. Stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy is a powerful super-resolution microscopy technique that enables observation of sub-cellular structures with spatial resolution well below the diffraction limit. The higher the STED beam intensity, the higher the resolution, but at the cost of increased photo-damage, which significantly limits the application of STED microscopy in live specimens. The separation by lifetime tuning (SPLIT) technique uses a time-resolved acquisition and a phasor-based analysis to efficiently distinguish photons emitted from the center and from the periphery of the effective fluorescent region, thus improves the resolution of STED microscopy without increasing the STED beam intensity. Furthermore, the SPLIT method is combined with a deep learning-based phasor analysis algorithm termed flimGANE (fluorescence lifetime imaging based on a generative adversarial network), to improve the robustness of SPLIT-STED allowing improving the resolution up to 1.45 folds at the half of the depletion laser beam intensity.. 2024\n",
            "Environmental and Health Impacts of Graphene and Other Two-Dimensional Materials: A Graphene Flagship Perspective. Two-dimensional (2D) materials have attracted tremendous interest ever since the isolation of atomically thin sheets of graphene in 2004 due to the specific and versatile properties of these materials. However, the increasing production and use of 2D materials necessitate a thorough evaluation of the potential impact on human health and the environment. Furthermore, harmonized test protocols are needed with which to assess the safety of 2D materials. The Graphene Flagship project (2013-2023), funded by the European Commission, addressed the identification of the possible hazard of graphene-based materials as well as emerging 2D materials including transition metal dichalcogenides, hexagonal boron nitride, and others. Additionally, so-called green chemistry approaches were explored to achieve the goal of a safe and sustainable production and use of this fascinating family of nanomaterials.

            "Diffusion-Based Unsupervised Pre-training for Automated Recognition of Vitality Forms. Social communication involves interpreting nonverbal behaviors, detecting and anticipating others' actions and intentions. Actions convey not only the goal and motor intention but also the form, i.e., variations in action execution. These variations, termed vitality forms, communicate attitudes during interactions, such as being gentle, calm, vigorous, and rude. Automatic vitality form recognition may have several applications in social robotics, social skills training, and therapy, yet it remains a rarely studied topic. This paper introduces an unsupervised pre-training approach that utilizes 2D-body key point trajectories as input and employs diffusion models to derive more effective features for representing these trajectories. The features learned from the diffusion model's encoder are utilized to train a multilayer perceptron for vitality form recognition. Experimental analysis showcases the superior performance of the proposed method not only across various videos but also for action classes not encountered during training.. 2024\n",
            "Densimeter-on-chip (DoC): measuring a single-cell mass density by sedimentation in microchannel flows. Intrinsic biophysical and morphological features are essential for the label-free identification of different cell types. Indeed, apart from object size, density could represent a key parameter for single-cell analysis. However, the measurement of such a parameter is challenging. Therefore, we present a straightforward and versatile microfluidic chip. The densimeter-on-chip (DoC) measures single-cell mass densities thanks to a hydrodynamically induced sedimentation process inside the microchannel. In detail, in-flow buoyant components become more relevant than viscoelastic alignment forces, leading to precise in-flow sedimentation. DoC is based on precise three-dimensional cell alignment, followed by an abrupt change in cross-section to induce calibrated sedimentation. Based on the balance of acting forces and tracking the in-flow cell trajectory, we have developed a self-written mathematical model to precisely measure the single-cell densities of multiple cell types of any shape. Both cell velocity and fall length define the resulting cell density. The working range of object diameters for which density can be estimated is 0.75-22.5 μm. As result, the minimum measured density is 998 kg m−3 and a sensitivity of 0.001 can be obtained. Great agreement between the computational and the literature findings about red blood cells (∼1159 ± 29.5 kg m−3), lymphocytes (∼1073 ± 49 kg m−3) and neutrophils (∼1093 ± 27 kg m−3) is obtained without chip modification. Indeed, the computational error between the mean density values is ∼1%. Thereby, DoC as an easy-to-use and reproducible solution for label-free single-cell density measurement, provides a universal approach for characterizing a wide range of cell types, independently of their size and shape.. 2025\n",

Upper-limb rehabilitation involves the repetition of the same movements in time. Mixed Reality (MR) technologies can be useful to both enhance patients’ engagement and provide guidance through visual and acoustic feedbacks. In this study we present the design of a MR serious game for the shoulder rehabilitation. The application was tested on five healthy subjects while performing a motion capture analysis with the aim to extrapolate normative volumes, associable to tunnels. In the future work, the resulting tunnel shapes will be then imported into the MR environment to be exploited as reference trajectories for pathologic subjects. The volumes can also be used to implement time-independent control strategies on an upper-limb exoskeleton.. 2022\n",

The λmodel implies a dynamic-compensation capability, determined by its non-linear stiffness. The stiffness grows with force, the intrinsic dynamic compensation capability is enhanced by means of co-contraction command.

            "Planning movements of redundant robots using an analogic approach. The classic AI approach to planning is fundamentally based on smart strategies in a discrete search space. In an analogic approach, on the contrary, basic representations are maps under the influence of complex dynamic systems and the role of 'inference' and 'reasoning' is taken by the simulation of their action. This approach has already been applied to Common Sense Reasoning and to Robotics. The key idea is that planning movements of redundant robots, which involves both robotic aspects as trajectory formation, navigation, obstacle avoidance, grasping, and AI aspects as action planning and representation of the world, can be solved by embedding these aspects into 'analogic experts', that are concurrent procedures operating in a direct and fast way on the world representation. The power of this paradigm lies in treating simultaneously shapes, collision avoidance, trajectories, redundancy and sequence planning, possible dynamic environments, which is, so far, an open problem.. 1990\n",
            "MEMORY EFFICIENT CORNER DETECTION FOR EVENT-DRIVEN DYNAMIC VISION SENSORS. Event cameras offer low-latency and data compression for visual applications, through event-driven operation, that can be exploited for edge processing in tiny autonomous agents. Robust, accurate and low latency extraction of highly informative features such as corners is key for most visual processing. While several corner detection algorithms have been proposed, state-of-the-art performance is achieved by “luvHarris”. However, this algorithm requires a high number of memory accesses per event, making it less-than ideal for low-latency, low-energy implementation in tiny edge processors. In this paper, we propose a new event-driven corner detection implementation tailored for edge computing devices, which requires much lower memory access than luvHarris while also improving accuracy. Our method trades computation for memory access, which is more expensive for large memories. For a DAVIS346 camera, our method requires ≈ 3.8X less memory, ≈ 36.6X less memory accesses with only ≈ 2.3X more computes.. 2024\n",
            "MX-LSTM: Mixing Tracklets and Vislets to Jointly Forecast Trajectories and Head Poses. Recent approaches on trajectory forecasting use tracklets to predict the future positions of pedestrians exploiting Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) architectures. This paper shows that adding vislets, that is, short sequences of head pose estimations, allows to increase significantly the trajectory forecasting performance. We then propose to use vislets in a novel framework called MX-LSTM, capturing the interplay between tracklets and vislets thanks to a joint unconstrained optimization of full covariance matrices during the LSTM backpropagation. At the same time, MX-LSTM predicts the future head poses, increasing the standard capabilities of the long-term trajectory forecasting approaches. With standard head pose estimators and an attentional-based social pooling, MX-LSTM scores the new trajectory forecasting state-of-the-art in all the considered datasets (Zara01, Zara02, UCY, and TownCentre) with a dramatic margin when the pedestrians slow down, a case where most of the forecasting approaches struggle to provide an accurate solution.. 2018\n",
            "Geometry as a catalyst: How vapor cavities nucleate from defects. The onset of cavitation is strongly enhanced by the presence of rough surfaces or impurities in the liquid. Despite decades of research, the way the geometry of these defects promote the nucleation of bubbles and its effect on the kinetics of the process remains largely unclear. We present here a comprehensive explanation of the catalytic action that roughness elements exert on the nucleation process for both pure vapor cavities and gas ones. This approach highlights that nucleation may follow nontrivial paths connected with a sharp decrease of the free energy barriers as compared to flat surfaces. Furthermore, we demonstrate the existence of intermediate metastable states that break the nucleation process in multiple steps; these states correspond to what is commonly known as cavitation nuclei. A single dimensionless parameter, the nucleation number, is found to control this rich phenomenology. The devised theory allows one to quantify the effect of the geometry and hydrophobicity of surface asperities on nucleation. Within the same framework, it is possible to treat both vapor cavitation, which is relevant, e.g., for organic liquids, and gas-promoted cavitation, which is commonly encountered in water. The theory is shown to be valid from the nano- to the macroscale. © 2013 American Chemical Society.. 2013\n",

Microalgae are unicellular photo-and heterotrophic organisms that, being efficient producers of a rich and complex biomass, have attracted global interest as biofactories for the production of high-value compounds (e.g. PUFAs, proteins and pigments) that can find application in nutraceutical, pharmaceutical and food industries. Microalgae have also been extensively studied in the last two decades, as potential producers of biofuels. However, based on current technologies, this production process is not economically sustainable yet.

            "White multi-layered polymer light emitting diode through matrix assisted pulsed laser evaporation. The development of alternative deposition techniques for conjugated polymeric compounds is an important step towards the fabrication of low cost multi-layered organic light emitting diodes suitable for display or lighting applications. In this work we show a white light-emitting polymeric hetero-structured diode consisting of three stacked blue, red and green light emitting polymers. In order to circumvent the issue of selecting orthogonal solvents in solution-deposition approaches, we combine spin-coating with a matrix-assisted pulsed laser evaporation technique, resulting in the realization of a polymeric multi-layered stack. By controlling the carriers and the energy transfer across the three light emitting layer interfaces, as well as the interplay between the deposition parameters, a pure white colour emission with Commission Internationale de l'Éclairage coordinates of (X = 0.327, Y = 0.374) and a Color Rendering Index of 70 has been achieved.

            "A new solvothermal approach to obtain nanoparticles in the Cu3SnS4–Cu2FeSnS4 join. In the field of the renewables, a large effort has been devoted in the last years to obtain conventional and new materials for solar energy conversion by using methods which couple a good efficiency and scalability with energetic and environmental concerns. This research has included the so-called kesterites, materials considered interesting for the thin-film solar cell technology, consisting of relatively abundant and harmless elements: Cu3–x–yFexZnySn(S,Se)4. In this study, we undertook the synthesis of members of the kuramite–stannite (Cu3SnS4–Cu2FeSnS4) join by means of a two-step solvothermal approach, able to provide nanocrystalline products in an easy, low-temperature, and fast way. The sample with the highest Fe concentration was characterised by means of a multi-analytical approach, aimed to assess not only its final structural, chemical and micromorphological features, but also the redox speciation of the two transition metal cations, i.e. Cu and Fe, in relation to the overall charge balance. Namely, Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR), Mössbauer and X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS) and SQUID magnetometry were involved. The main results point out an excellent control of the structural features, and an intermediate Fe content in the sample, leading to the following formula unit: Cu2.2Fe0.48Sn1.2S4. The overall findings of the multi-analytical characterization imply a complex redox balance, where inferring the site occupancy is not trivial; the charge balance, in fact, can only be achieved taking into account the presence of both Fe(III) and vacancies. Moreover, Fe is distributed over two different crystallographic sites.. 2020\n",
            "Microstructure and Electrical Properties of Novel piezo-optrodes Based on Thin-Film Piezoelectric Aluminium Nitride for Sensing. Thin-film piezoelectric materials are currently employed in micro-and nanodevices for energy harvesting and mechanical sensing. The deposition of these functional layers, however, is quite challenging onto non-rigid/non-flat substrates, such as optical fibers (OFs). Besides the recent novel applications of OFs as probes for biosensing and bioactuation, the possibility to combine them with piezoelectric thin films and metallic electrodes can pave the way for the employment of novel opto-electro-mechanical sensors (e.g., waveguides, optical phase modulators, tunable filters, energy harvesters or biosensors). In this work the deposition of a thin-film piezoelectric wurtzite-phase Aluminium Nitride (AlN), sandwiched between molybdenum (Mo) electrodes, on the curved lateral surface of an optical fiber with polymeric cladding, is reported for the first time, without the need of an orientation-promoting interlayer. The material surface properties and morphology are characterized by microscopy techniques. High orientation is demonstrated by SEM, PFM and X-ray diffraction analysis on a flat polymeric control, with a resulting piezoelectric coefficient (d33) of ∼5.4 pm/V, while the surface roughness Rms measured by AFM is 9 ÷ 16 nm. The output mechanical sensing capability of the resulting AlN-based piezo-optrode is investigated through mechanical buckling tests: The peak-To-peak voltage for weakly impulsive loads increases with increasing relative displacements (up to 30%), in the range of 20 ÷ 35 mV. Impedance spectroscopy frequency sweeps (10 kHz-1 MHz, 1 V) demonstrate a sensor capacitance of ∼8 pF, with an electrical Q factor as high as 150.

Most existing person re-identification (Re-ID) approaches follow a supervised learning framework, in which a large number of labelled matching pairs are required for training. This severely limits their scalability in realworld applications. To overcome this limitation, we develop a novel cross-dataset transfer learning approach to learn a discriminative representation. It is unsupervised in the sense that the target dataset is completely unlabelled. Specifically, we present an multi-task dictionary learning method which is able to learn a dataset-shared but targetdata-biased representation.

            "Transmission of reduced levels of miR-34/449 from sperm to preimplantation embryos is a key step in the transgenerational epigenetic inheritance of the effects of paternal chronic social instability stress. The transgenerational effects of exposing male mice to chronic social instability (CSI) stress are associated with decreased sperm levels of multiple members of the miR-34/449 family that persist after their mating through preimplantation embryo (PIE) development. Here we demonstrate the importance of these miRNA changes by showing that restoring miR-34c levels in PIEs derived from CSI stressed males prevents elevated anxiety and defective sociability normally found specifically in their adult female offspring. It also restores, at least partially, levels of sperm miR-34/449 normally reduced in their male offspring who transmit these sex-specific traits to their offspring. Strikingly, these experiments also revealed that inducing miR-34c levels in PIEs enhances the expression of its own gene and that of miR-449 in these cells. The same induction of embryo miR-34/449 gene expression likely occurs after sperm-derived miR-34c is introduced into oocytes upon fertilization. Thus, suppression of this miRNA amplification system when sperm miR-34c levels are reduced in CSI stressed mice can explain how a comparable fold-suppression of miR-34/449 levels can be found in PIEs derived from them, despite sperm containing ~50-fold lower levels of these miRNAs than those already present in PIEs. We previously found that men exposed to early life trauma also display reduced sperm levels of miR-34/449. And here we show that miR-34c can also increase the expression of its own gene, and that of miR-449 in human embryonic stem cells, suggesting that human PIEs derived from men with low sperm miR-34/449 levels may also contain this potentially harmful defect.. 2024\n",

The interpretability of gait analysis studies in people with rare diseases, such as those with primary hereditary cerebellar ataxia (pwCA), is frequently limited by the small sample sizes and unbalanced datasets. The purpose of this study was to assess the effectiveness of data balancing and generative artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms in generating synthetic data reflecting the actual gait abnormalities of pwCA. Gait data of 30 pwCA (age: 51.6 ± 12.2 years; 13 females, 17 males) and 100 healthy subjects (age: 57.1 ± 10.4; 60 females, 40 males) were collected at the lumbar level with an inertial measurement unit.

Consistency and explainability metrics were also calculated to assess the coherence of the generated dataset with known gait abnormalities of pwCA. ctGAN significantly improved the classification performance compared with the original dataset and traditional data augmentation methods. ctGAN are effective methods for balancing tabular datasets from populations with rare diseases, owing to their ability to improve diagnostic models with consistent explainability.. 2024\n",
            "Moving in unison after perceptual interruption. Humans interact in groups through various perception and action channels. The continuity of interaction despite a transient loss of perceptual contact often exists and contributes to goal achievement. Here, we study the dynamics of this continuity, in two experiments involving groups of participants (N= 7) synchronizing their movements in space and in time. We show that behavioural unison can be maintained after perceptual contact has been lost, for about 7s. Agent similarity and spatial configuration in the group modulated synchronization performance, differently so when perceptual interaction was present or when it was memorized. Modelling these data through a network of oscillators enabled us to clarify the double origin of this memory effect, of individual and social nature. These results shed new light into why humans continue to move in unison after perceptual interruption, and are consequential for a wide variety of applications at work, in art and in sport.. 2020\n",
            "Differences in Intrinsic Gray Matter Connectivity and Their Genomic Underpinnings in Autism Spectrum Disorder. Background: Autism is a heterogeneous neurodevelopmental condition accompanied by differences in brain connectivity. Structural connectivity in autism has mainly been investigated within the white matter. However, many genetic variants associated with autism highlight genes related to synaptogenesis and axonal guidance, thus also implicating differences in intrinsic (i.e., gray matter) connections in autism. Intrinsic connections may be assessed in vivo via so-called intrinsic global and local wiring costs. Methods: Here, we examined intrinsic global and local wiring costs in the brain of 359 individuals with autism and 279 healthy control participants ages 6 to 30 years from the EU-AIMS LEAP (Longitudinal European Autism Project). FreeSurfer was used to derive surface mesh representations to compute the estimated length of connections required to wire the brain within the gray matter. Vertexwise between-group differences were assessed using a general linear model. A gene expression decoding analysis based on the Allen Human Brain Atlas was performed to link neuroanatomical differences to putative underpinnings. Results: Group differences in global and local wiring costs were predominantly observed in medial and lateral prefrontal brain regions, in inferior temporal regions, and at the left temporoparietal junction. The resulting neuroanatomical patterns were enriched for genes that had been previously implicated in the etiology of autism at genetic and transcriptomic levels. Conclusions: Based on intrinsic gray matter connectivity, the current study investigated the complex neuroanatomy of autism and linked between-group differences to putative genomic and/or molecular mechanisms to parse the heterogeneity of autism and provide targets for future subgrouping approaches.. 2024\n",

In this paper, we encode semantics of a text document in an image to take advantage of the same Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) that have been successfully employed to image classification. We use Word2Vec, which is an estimation of word representation in a vector space that can maintain the semantic and syntactic relationships among words. Word2Vec vectors are transformed into graphical words representing sequence of words in the text document. The encoded images are classified by using the AlexNet architecture. We introduced a new dataset named Text-Ferramenta gathered from an Italian price comparison website and we evaluated the encoding scheme through this dataset along with two publicly available datasets i.e. 20news-bydate and StackOverflow. Our scheme outperforms the text classification approach based on Doc2Vec and Support Vector Machine (SVM) when all the words of a text document can be completely encoded in an image. We believe that the results on these datasets are an interesting starting point for many Natural Language Processing works based on CNNs, such as a multimodal approach that could use a single CNN to classify both image and text information.. 2017\n",

The three micropumps have different working principles (electromagnetic, electrolytic and peristaltic actuation methods), but they share the same fabrication process. The reason for adopting three different actuation modes is mainly related to the different functionalities that have to be managed at microfluidic level.

Silver particles with spiky nanostructured morphologies have been obtained by two different wet-synthesis approaches. A detailed investigation was carried out into the synthesis parameters to tune the shape of the sample into desert-rose- and succulent-like particles. The first synthetic route was based on the reduction of silver nitrate by iron sulfate in the presence of maleic acid as anisotropic agent, whereas in the second method ascorbic acid was used as the reducing agent and citric acid as the anisotropic agent. A nucleation model is proposed to explain the growth mechanism and the effect of each parameter on the particle morphology. These Ag nanostructured spiky particles have been used as conductive fillers in polymeric piezoresistive composites, the working principle of which is based on the tunneling conduction mechanism.

To test the hypothesis that the interaction between polyQ-AR and androgens exerts cell-autonomous toxicity in skeletal muscle, we characterized the process of myogenesis and polyQ-AR expression in DHT-treated satellite cells obtained from SBMA patients and age-matched healthy control subjects. Treatment with androgens increased the size and number of myonuclei in myotubes from control subjects, but not from SBMA patients. Myotubes from SBMA patients had a reduced number of nuclei, suggesting impaired myotube fusion and altered contractile structures. The lack of anabolic effects of androgens on myotubes from SBMA patients was not due to defects in myoblast proliferation, differentiation or apoptosis. DHT treatment of myotubes from SBMA patients increased nuclear accumulation of polyQ-AR and decreased the expression of interleukin-4 (IL-4) when compared to myotubes from control subjects. Following DHT treatment, exposure of myotubes from SBMA patients with IL-4 treatment rescued myonuclear number and size to control levels. This supports the hypothesis that androgens alter the fusion process in SBMA myogenesis. In conclusion, these results provide evidence of an androgen-dependent impairment of myogenesis in SBMA that could contribute to disease pathogenesis. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.. 2013\n",
            "Role of the electrode morphology on the optimal thickness of BiVO4 anodes for photoelectrochemical water splitting cells. Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting is one of the most promising technologies able to exploit renewable resources such as water and sunlight for the sustainable production of energy carriers (i.e. H2, solar fuels). Recently, it was demonstrated that the currents through a PEC water splitting cell present a maximum for a specific thickness of the photocatalytic anode film (J. Electroanal. Chem. 2017, 788, 61–65 ), which is related to the attenuation of the light in the semiconductor layer and to the applied bias potential. In this work, it is shown that this non-monotonic behavior is not only due to the trade-off between the absorption length of light and thickness of a photocatalyst (e.g. BiVO4) film, but mainly to the porous nature of the semiconducting material. A theoretical analysis of such behavior for an ideal compact medium shows a very broad maximum, in contrast to the experimental values that present steeper slopes both at low and large thicknesses (e.g. for films prepared by dip-coating method). There have been taken into account, subsequently, the loss of useful current at grain boundaries, due to an increased number of recombination centers, the reduction of specific area (less porosity) as the grains increase in size when increasing the number of dip-coatings, the possible non-uniform coverage of the substrate by the BiVO4 for a low number of coatings, and the partial blocking of pores with oxygen bubbles under operation. For each of these considerations, a normalized current plot in terms of the number of coatings has shown a remarkably good concordance to the experimental data.. 2017\n",
            "Modulation of the electronic structure of polyconjugated organic molecules by geometry relaxation: A discussion based on local Raman parameters. The Raman response of some polyconjugated materials is analyzed on the basis of local Raman parameters 〈∂α/∂RCC〉 determined by Density Functional Theory calculations and discussed in the frame of the Effective Conjugation Coordinate Theory. This approach allows to explain Raman spectra even when a deviation from the common behaviour is observed, thus providing a key for the interpretation of the main spectroscopic features in terms of structural parameters. The examples reported demonstrate that any change of the 〈BLA〉 parameter, describing the average degree of CC bond alternation along a conjugated sequence, is reflected by a remarkable modulation of the Raman spectrum, which indeed shows the signature of the molecular and electronic structure resulting from different chemical substitutions, conformation changes, chain length and environment effects. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The electronic properties of Fe islands grown on reconstructed Au(111) were investigated by means of scanning tunneling spectroscopy and density-functional theory calculations. A characteristic peak measured in the electron local density of states at Fermi level indicates the presence of a nondispersive minority Fe dz2 state. The peak energy was measured to shift from occupied to unoccupied states as a function of position within Fe islands. We related this effect to the reconstruction-induced local Fe-Fe bond length variation. © 2011 American Physical Society.. 2011\n",
            "Dynamical Rashba Band Splitting in Hybrid Perovskites Modeled by Local Electric Fields. We report a computational method for evaluating the dynamical Rashba interaction coefficient of tetragonal and cubic methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) perovskite, at various size scales, through Car-Parrinello molecular dynamics trajectories. This strategy involves the calculation of a time-dependent band structure of the target systems using periodic boundary conditions and the evaluation of the amplitude of band-splitting due to the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) with the computation of a local electric field. This model, physically motivated by a rewriting of the SOC Hamiltonian according to the heterogeneity of three-dimensional systems and our choice of k-space sampling, involves directly the methylammonium configuration space sampling. Originally applied to tetragonal and cubic unit cells with static point-charges, this model is further ameliorated in order to take into account the replication of this unit cell through space and to account for the dynamical nature of charge distribution. Once our protocol has been calibrated based on a toy model, it is exploited for investigating MAPbI3 systems in both tetragonal and cubic phases.. 2018\n",
            "Graphene-Based Transparent Flexible Strain Gauges with Tunable Sensitivity and Strain Range. Monolayers of graphene oxide, assembled into densely packed sheets at an immiscible hexane/water interface, form transparent conducting films on polydimethylsiloxane membranes after reduction in hydroiodic acid (HI) vapor to reduced graphene oxide (rGO). Prestraining and relaxing the membranes introduces cracks in the rGO film. Subsequent straining opens these cracks and induces piezoresistivity, enabling their application as transparent strain gauges. The sensitivity and strain range of these gauges is controlled by the cracked film structure that is determined by the reducing conditions used in manufacture. Reduction for 30 s in HI vapor leads to an array of parallel cracks that do not individually span the membrane. These cracks do not extend on subsequent straining, leading to a gauge with a usable strain range >0.2 and gauge factor (GF) at low strains ranging from 20 to 100, depending on the prestrain applied. The GF reduces with increasing applied strain and asymptotes to about 3, for all prestrains. Reduction for 60 s leads to cracks spanning the entire membrane and an increased film resistance but a highly sensitive strain gauge, with GF ranging from 800 to 16,000. However, the usable strain range reduces to <0.01. A simple equivalent resistor model is proposed to describe the behavior of both gauge types. The gauges show a repeatable and stable response with loading frequencies >1 kHz and have been used to detect human body strains in a simple e-skin demonstration.. 2023\n",
            "3D breast cancer microtissue reveals the role of tumor microenvironment on the transport and efficacy of free-doxorubicin in vitro. The use of 3D cancer models will have both ethical and economic impact in drug screening and development, to promote the reduction of the animals employed in preclinical studies. Nevertheless, to be effective, such cancer surrogates must preserve the physiological relevance of the in vivo models in order to provide realistic information on drugs’ efficacy. To figure out the role of the architecture and composition of 3D cancer models on their tumor-mimicking capability, here we studied the efficacy of doxorubicin (DOX), a well-known anticancer molecule in two different 3D cancer models: our 3D breast cancer microtissue (3D-μTP) versus the golden standard represented by spheroid model (sph). Both models were obtained by using cancer associated fibroblast (CAF) and breast cancer cells (MCF-7) as cellular component. Unlike spheroid model, 3D-μTP was engineered in order to induce the production of endogenous extracellular matrix by CAF. 3D-μTP have been compared to spheroid in mono- (MCF-7 alone) and co-culture (MCF-7/CAF), after the treatment with DOX in order to study cytotoxicity effect, diffusional transport and expression of proteins related to cancer progression. Compared to the spheroid model, 3D-μTP showed higher diffusion coefficient of DOX and lower cell viability. Also, the expression of some tumoral biomarkers related to cell junctions were different in the two models. Statements of Significance: Cancer biology has made progress in unraveling the mechanism of cancer progression, anyway the most of the results are still obtained by 2D cell cultures or animal models, that do not faithfully copycat the tumor microenvironment. The lack of correlation between preclinical models and in vivo organisms negatively influences the clinical efficacy of chemotherapeutic drugs. Consequently, even if a huge amount of new drugs has been developed in the last decades, still people are dying because of cancer. Pharmaceutical companies are interested in 3D tumor model as valid alternative in drug screening in preclinical studies. However, a 3D tumor model that completely mimics tumor heterogeneity is still far to achieve. In our work we compare 3D human breast cancer microtissues and spheroids in terms of response to doxorubicin and drug diffusion. We believe that our results are interesting because they highlight the potential role of the proposed tumor model in the attempts to improve efficacy tests.. 2018\n",
            "Dye-Sensitized Photocatalytic Hydrogen Generation: Efficiency Enhancement by Organic Photosensitizer-Coadsorbent Intermolecular Interaction. Dye-sensitized photocatalytic H2 generation has been investigated using a metal-free phenothiazine-based donor-acceptor sensitizer (PTZ-GLU) in combination with coadsorbents. The coadsorption of the PTZ-GLU dye, functionalized with a glucose end-group, in combination with a glucose-based coadsorbent, afforded improved photocatalytic activity compared to the absence of coadsorbents, to the use of a conventional (chenodeoxycholic acid) coadsorbent, or by replacing the dye glucose functionality with an alkyl chain. The results suggest the strategic role of directional intermolecular dye-coadsorbent interactions on the semiconductor surface, as confirmed by first principles computational modeling, which likely suppressed detrimental recombination processes.. 2018\n",
            "Design criteria and HPF modeling of nonlinear optical waveguides characterized by second harmonic generation process. Recent studies of χ (2) processes and the quasi-phase matching (QPM) technique promote research works on nonlinear optic (NLO) devices for ultrafast signal processing based on second-order nonlinearity and optical switching. In particular, the research was directed to implementation of a compact and efficient coherent light source by combining the SHG device with a semiconductor laser in the same optical system. The NLO devices are also suitable for all-optical wavelength converters oriented on dense wavelength divisionmultiplexing (DWDM) optical communication systems. In particular thesecond harmonic generation in χ (2) nonlinear process represents a good solution for DWDM applications in telecommunication systems and in wireless systems suitable for robotic sensors and aerospace implementation. But this process requires high intensity input power and large interaction lengths for a good second harmonic (SH) conversion. For this reasons the introduction of tailored structures which enhance the SH field is important. This chapter provides the design criteria of periodic structure for SH enhancement, including an new theoretical approach based on the Hertzian Potential Formulation.. 2012\n",
            "Axial super-resolution by mirror-reflected stimulated emission depletion microscopy. In stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy, the lateral resolution is in the range of tens of nanometers depending on the sample and the instrument. The axial resolution, however, is in standard systems limited by diffraction to about 500 nm. We present an approach to three-dimensional diffraction-unlimited resolution by observing the sample at two optical angles. The system is realized by using an atomic force microscope (AFM) chip as a microreflector to deflect the STED beams near the region-of-interest (ROI), thus allowing observations at an angle ∠. Consequently, the superior lateral resolution can be utilized to resolve details in the axial direction of the main optical axis of the microscope. Here, fluorescent nanoparticles 90 nm apart and biological structures 80 nm apart along axial direction were distinguished by utilizing an off-the-shelf, commercial STED microscope, coupled with an AFM and an AFM chip micro-reflector.. 2014\n",

            "Development of Nanostructured Lipid Carriers for the Delivery of Idebenone in Autosomal Recessive Spastic Ataxia of Charlevoix-Saguenay. Oxidative stress occurs when physiological antioxidant systems do not manage to counteract the excessive intracellular production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which accumulate leading to irreversible oxidation of DNA and other biomacromolecules, and thus to the onset of pathological conditions. Autosomal recessive spastic ataxia of Charlevoix-Saguenay (ARSACS) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by autosomal recessive mutations in the sacsin gene (SACS). It has been demonstrated that cells of ARSACS patients show bioenergetic and mitochondrial impairment, denoted by reduced respiratory chain activities and ATP synthesis. In order to design a suitable therapy for ARSACS, it is essential to consider that treatments need to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB), a specialized structure that separates the subtle environment of the brain from blood circulation. Nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs), constituted by a solid lipid shell and a liquid lipid phase in the core, have been fabricated for loading hydrophobic molecules, improving their bioavailability. Idebenone (IDE), a synthetic analogue of coenzyme Q10, is able to inhibit lipid peroxidation and detoxify several free radicals. However, because of its poor solubility, it requires ad hoc drug-delivery systems for enhancing its pharmacokinetic properties, preventing undesired cytotoxicity. In this work, NLCs loaded with idebenone (IDE-NLCs) have been prepared. The nanovectors have been physicochemically characterized, and their biological activity has been evaluated on different central nervous system cell lines. IDE-NLCs demonstrated to be stable in water and in cell culture media, and showed a sustained drug release profile. Interestingly, preliminary data demonstrated their ability to permeate an in vitro BBB model. Their protective antioxidant activity in human healthy primary skin fibroblasts and their therapeutic efficacy in ARSACS-derived primary skin fibroblasts have been also investigated, showing their potential for future development as therapeutic agents.. 2020\n",

We theoretically investigate the generation of far-field propagating optical beams with a desired orbital angular momentum by using an archetypical magnetoplasmonic tip surrounded by a gold spiral slit. The use of a magnetic material can lead to important implications once magneto-optical activity is activated through the application of an external magnetic field. The physical model and the numerical study presented here introduce the concept of magnetically tunable plasmonic vortex lens, namely a magnetoplasmonic vortex lens, which ensures a tunable selectivity in the polarization state of the generated nanostructured beam. The presented system provides a promising platform for a localized excitation of plasmonic vortices followed by their beaming in the far-field with an active modulation of both light's transmission and helicity.. 2017\n",

            "Biallelic DMXL2 mutations impair autophagy and cause Ohtahara syndrome with progressive course. Ohtahara syndrome, early infantile epileptic encephalopathy with a suppression burst EEG pattern, is an aetiologically heterogeneous condition starting in the first weeks or months of life with intractable seizures and profound developmental disability. Using whole exome sequencing, we identified biallelic DMXL2 mutations in three sibling pairs with Ohtahara syndrome, belonging to three unrelated families. Siblings in Family 1 were compound heterozygous for the c.5135C4T (p.Ala1712Val) missense substitution and the c.4478C4G (p.Ser1493*) nonsense substitution; in Family 2 were homozygous for the c.4478C4A (p.Ser1493*) nonsense substitution and in Family 3 were homozygous for the c.7518-1G4A (p.Trp2507Argfs*4) substitution. The severe developmental and epileptic encephalopathy manifested from the first day of life and was associated with deafness, mild peripheral polyneuropathy and dysmorphic features. Early brain MRI investigations in the first months of life revealed thin corpus callosum with brain hypomyelination in all. Follow-up MRI scans in three patients revealed progressive moderate brain shrinkage with leukoencephalopathy. Five patients died within the first 9 years of life and none achieved developmental, communicative or motor skills following birth. These clinical findings are consistent with a developmental brain disorder that begins in the prenatal brain, prevents neural connections from reaching the expected stages at birth, and follows a progressive course. DMXL2 is highly expressed in the brain and at synaptic terminals, regulates v-ATPase assembly and activity and participates in intracellular signalling pathways; however, its functional role is far from complete elucidation. Expression analysis in patient-derived skin fibroblasts demonstrated absence of the DMXL2 protein, revealing a loss of function phenotype. Patients’ fibroblasts also exhibited an increased LysoTrackerÕ signal associated with decreased endolysosomal markers and degradative processes. Defective endolysosomal homeostasis was accompanied by impaired autophagy, revealed by lower LC3II signal, accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins, and autophagy receptor p62, with morphological alterations of the autolysosomal structures on electron microscopy. Altered lysosomal homeostasis and defective autophagy were recapitulated in Dmxl2-silenced mouse hippocampal neurons, which exhibited impaired neurite elongation and synaptic loss. Impaired lysosomal function and autophagy caused by biallelic DMXL2 mutations affect neuronal development and synapse formation and result in Ohtahara syndrome with profound developmental impairment and reduced life expectancy.. 2019\n",

            "Nanotechnologies for tissue engineering and regeneration: Nanoengineered/nanopatterned materials for cell and tissue guidance. © 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.Stem cells (SCs) can self-renew or differentiate into different cell types, which makes them an ideal cell source for therapies based on tissue engineering. Despite these characteristics, the employment of SCs in clinics has seen alternating fortunes because of our limited understanding of the signals governing SC functions and fate, which impairs our ability to engineer systems to deliver SCs in vivo and to guide their correct biological processes. However, experimental evidence demonstrated that SCs are able to recognize biochemical and biophysical signals displayed by material surfaces; most importantly, cells integrate these signals to elaborate fate decisions. Although the mechanisms underlying signal recognition and response have not been thoroughly characterized, there is a general consensus that the cell adhesion process plays a central role. Adhesion represents a communication gate between exogenous signals and intracellular signaling cascades involving the cytoskeleton and the nucleus. In this work we present recent findings on materials engineered to control cell functions through adhesion processes. In particular, we emphasize the role of material signals on SC behavior. Finally, we discuss a few sensing and transductive molecular mechanisms in an effort to draw out unifying elements concerning cell recognition of and reaction to biophysical/biochemical material signals aimed at controlling cell fate through cell adhesion.Microneedles and nanomedicine are two out of several active innovative approaches used to enhance the transdermal drug and vaccine delivery. Their application individually or in combination have shown to be very promising and attracted considerable interest by researchers from both industry and academia over the last 2 decades.Combining the two technologies has growing interest and has shown to be promising approach not only in enhancing the transdermal drug and vaccine permeation for even difficult drug molecules, such as hydrophilic and macromolecules, but also impart protection and controlling the drug release rates. In Subchapter 2.2, we aim to highlight the advances, which has been made in using these two technologies as an individual or in combination with drug and vaccine delivery.Metal implants, in the form of screws, plates, or pins, are extensively used in the treatment of fractures and nonunions or as replacements for malfunctioned joints. These bones implants face many challenges for acceptance and survival upon insertion in the human body. These challenges include severe inflammation, bacterial invasion, and poor biointegration with the traumatized tissue. Titania (TiO2) nanotubes (TNTs) arrays engineered on the surface of Ti implants by simple and scalable electrochemical anodization process, which have been widely explored as a new nanoengineering approach to improve the process of osseointegration and at the same time to be used as depots for loading drugs and their controllable release for localized delivery, and therapeutic purpose. Several advanced functions can be introduced into these multifunctional implants, including biopolymers, nanoparticles or external stimulation (e.g., electrical, electromagnetic and ultrasound) to release the loaded therapeutic agents in a desired manner when required. Subchapter 2.3 highlights the developed concepts of drug releasing implants based on TNTs for enhancing osteogenesis at the bone-implant interface, as an alternative approach to systemic delivery of therapeutic agents.The reconstruction of skeletal defects is a continuing challenge. Bone and dentin are mineralized hard tissues. The primary inorganic component of these two tissues is crystalline hydroxyapatite and the primary organic component is type I collagen, and these two components are cell-manufactured materials. Tissue-engineering strategies using novel biomaterials have emerged as a promising potential for the treatment of mineralization defects. Some of the recent bioinspired biomaterials utilize proteins and peptides as nanoscale building blocks. A key functional property is that biomaterials need to be cell-compatible and mimic the dynamic nature of the extracellular matrix. ECM is a complex environment comprising a plethora of macromolecules. Another class of novel biomaterials that are currently being developed are peptide-based hydrogels. Peptide-based engineered scaffolds present several advantages over traditional protein scaffolds as the control over hydrogel properties and can be easily tailored to the requirement of the tissue. Biomaterials generated by the self-assembly process have varied applications as it mimics nature's method of material synthesis. Therefore, concepts of protein-based self-assembly can be utilized for constructing useful biomaterials.. 2017\n",

Moreover, the o(1/k) convergence rate in the function values is obtained if slightly stronger differentiability assumptions are added.

In the last decades an innovative technique has emerged in clinical gastroenterology as a compelling alternative to the traditional wired endoscopy, known as Wireless Capsule Endoscopy (WCE). Such cutting-edge application is able to investigate the gastrointestinal (GI) tract through a miniaturized, swallowable and biocompatible capsule, equipped with electronic components. This allows for the non-invasive measurement of biological data, that is then sent to an external receiving unit through a wireless link. This systematic review prepared according to PRISMA guidelines focuses on the main technological advances of data transmission from the in-body ingestible capsule to an external receiver. A total of 142 studies were screened from a comprehensive literature search, performed in Scopus, Science Direct, and IEEE Xplore database. A final number of 47 met the inclusion criteria and were included in the review. The results highlight innovative technologies to optimize the wireless link efficacy and safety to an external receiver. High gain, wideband, omnidirectional radiation pattern, and low levels of specific absorption rate (SAR) are of crucial importance.

            "Electroless formation of silver nanoaggregates: An experimental and molecular dynamics approach. The ability to manipulate matter to create non-conventional structures is one of the key issues of material science. The understanding of assembling mechanism at the nanoscale allows us to engineer new nanomaterials, with physical properties intimately depending on their structure.This paper describes new strategies to obtain and characterise metal nanostructures via the combination of a top-down method, such as electron beam lithography, and a bottom-up technique, such as the chemical electroless deposition. We realised silver nanoparticle aggregates within well-defined patterned holes created by electron beam lithography on silicon substrates. The quality characteristics of the nanoaggregates were verified by using scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy imaging. Moreover, we compared the experimental findings to molecular dynamics simulations of nanoparticles growth. We observed a very high dependence of the structure characteristics on the pattern nanowell aspect ratio. We found that high-quality metal nanostructures may be obtained in patterns with well aspect ratio close to one, corresponding to a maximum diameter of 50 nm, a limit above which the fabricated structures become less regular and discontinuous. When regular shapes and sizes are necessary, as in nanophotonics, these results suggest the pattern characteristics to obtain isolated, uniform and reproducible metal nanospheres. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.. 2014\n",
            "Fabrication of nonplanar tapered fibers to integrate optical and electrical signals for neural interfaces in vivo. Implantable multifunctional probes have transformed neuroscience research, offering access to multifaceted brain activity that was previously unattainable. Typically, simultaneous access to both optical and electrical signals requires separate probes, while their integration into a single device can result in the emergence of photogenerated electrical artifacts, affecting the quality of high-frequency neural recordings. Among the nontrivial strategies aimed at the realization of an implantable multifunctional interface, the integration of optical and electrical capabilities on a single, minimally invasive, tapered optical fiber probe has been recently demonstrated using fibertrodes. Fibertrodes require the application of a set of planar microfabrication techniques to a nonplanar system with low and nonconstant curvature radius. Here we develop a process based on multiple conformal depositions, nonplanar two-photon lithography and chemical wet etching steps to obtain metallic patterns on the highly curved surface of the fiber taper. We detail the manufacturing, encapsulation and back end of the fibertrodes. The design of the probe can be adapted for different experimental requirements. Using the optical setup design, it is possible to perform angle selective light coupling with the fibertrodes and their implantation and use in vivo. The fabrication of fibertrodes is estimated to require 5–9 d. Nonetheless, due to the high scalability of a large part of the protocol, the manufacture of multiple fibertrodes simultaneously substantially reduces the required time for each probe. The procedure is suitable for users with expertise in microfabrication of electronics and neural recordings.. 2025\n",

The analysis of archaeological objects poses a set of challenges related to the fragility and uniqueness of the material and requires special non-invasive techniques. This article presents applications of Synchrotron X-ray Computed Tomography (SXCT) on archaeological vitreous materials, namely glass, faience, and Egyptian blue. Using five different case studies, we provide protocols developed at the beamline ID10-BEATS of SESAME (Jordan) to understand raw material, production, and degradation of vitreous assemblages from sub-mm to several cm in size. The use of high-resolution 3-dimensional X-ray imaging combined with phase-contrast generation allows to identify and differentiate ancient faience and pigment production technologies, quantify the severity and microstructure of glass corrosion, and assess the fracture and mechanical fragility of large artifacts and assemblies such as mosaics.

For dexterous control of the hand, humans integrate sensory information and prior knowledge regarding their bodies and the world. We studied the role of touch in hand motor control by challenging a fundamental prior assumption—that self-motion of inanimate objects is unlikely upon contact. In a reaching task, participants slid their fingertips across a robotic interface, with their hand hidden from sight. Unbeknownst to the participants, the robotic interface remained static, followed hand movement, or moved in opposition to it. We considered two hypotheses. Either participants were able to account for surface motion or, if the stationarity assumption held, they would integrate the biased tactile cues and proprioception. Motor errors consistent with the latter hypothesis were observed. The role of visual feedback, tactile sensitivity, and friction was also investigated. Our study carries profound implications for human-machine collaboration in a world where objects may no longer conform to the stationarity assumption.. 2024\n",

            "Quantitative electron tomography investigation of a TiO2 based solar cell photoanode. The development of efficient thin film solar cells requires a deep knowledge of the nanoscale morphology of the active layers. While conventional investigation is usually limited to 2D information, here we use electron tomography to unravel a complex particle network in a non-ambiguous, 3D reconstruction. We present our study of a dye sensitised solar cell, based on a nanostructured TiO2 photoanode produced by pulsed laser deposition (PLD) and displaying a hierarchical, quasi-1D arrangement. We prepare the sample for electron tomography using focused ion beam (FIB) milling to obtain a micro-pillar, instead of a conventional TEM lamella. This approach has the advantage of allowing higher quality tomographic reconstructions of complex morphologies due to the increased tilt range available and the constant thickness of the section.

We compare the findings with a photoanode based on a conventional TiO2 paste, determining the anisotropy of the PLD-grown film.

            "Tools and methods to study and replicate experiments addressing human social cognition in interactive scenarios. In the last decade, scientists investigating human social cognition have started bringing traditional laboratory paradigms more “into the wild” to examine how socio-cognitive mechanisms of the human brain work in real-life settings. As this implies transferring 2D observational paradigms to 3D interactive environments, there is a risk of compromising experimental control. In this context, we propose a methodological approach which uses humanoid robots as proxies of social interaction partners and embeds them in experimental protocols that adapt classical paradigms of cognitive psychology to interactive scenarios. This allows for a relatively high degree of “naturalness” of interaction and excellent experimental control at the same time. Here, we present two case studies where our methods and tools were applied and replicated across two different laboratories, namely the Italian Institute of Technology in Genova (Italy) and the Agency for Science, Technology and Research in Singapore. In the first case study, we present a replication of an interactive version of a gaze-cueing paradigm reported in Kompatsiari et al. (J Exp Psychol Gen 151(1):121–136, 2022). The second case study presents a replication of a “shared experience” paradigm reported in Marchesi et al. (Technol Mind Behav 3(3):11, 2022). As both studies replicate results across labs and different cultures, we argue that our methods allow for reliable and replicable setups, even though the protocols are complex and involve social interaction. We conclude that our approach can be of benefit to the research field of social cognition and grant higher replicability, for example, in cross-cultural comparisons of social cognition mechanisms.. 2024\n",
            "VARO-Fi: A Variable Orientable Gripper to Obtain In-Hand Manipulation. This paper proposes a novel gripper or end-effector named VARO-fi (VARiable Orientable fingers with translation), with the aim of obtaining human like prehensile manoeuvre such as, in-hand manipulation. The 4 fingered VARO-fi consists of 9 degrees of freedom and it can perform several in-hand manipulation tasks which have been described in this paper. Moreover, the gripper is a simplification of previously proposed gripper platform called Dexclar. The derivation of VARO-fi has been presented and its capabilities have been demonstrated by experiments. Although a generic convex payload is considered as a primitive in the design of VARO-fi however, it is capable to address manipulation for other regular shaped payloads, which has been proven by experiments. A comparison is also illustrated in order to underline the strength of the novel gripper with respect to the state of the art.. 2018\n",
            "Ctrl-MORE: A Framework to Integrate Controllers of Multi-DoF Robot for Developers and Users. In recent years, many different feedback controllers for robotic applications have been proposed and implemented. However, the high coupling between the different software modules made their integration into one common architecture difficult. Consequently, this has hindered the ability of a user to employ the different controllers into a single, general and modular framework. To address this problem, we present Ctrl-MORE, a software architecture developed to fill the gap between control developers and other users in robotic applications. On one hand, Ctrl-MORE aims to provide developers with an opportunity to integrate easily and share their controllers with other roboticists working in different areas. For example, manipulation, locomotion, vision and so on. On the other hand, it provides to end-users a tool to apply the additional control strategies that guarantee the execution of desired behaviors in a transparent, yet efficient way. The proposed control architecture allows an easier integration of general purpose feedback controllers, such as stabilizers, with higher control layers such as trajectory planners, increasing the robustness of the overall system.. 2018\n",

            "Platinum Nanozyme Probes for Cellular Imaging by Electron Microscopy. The highly efficient peroxidase-like activity of platinum nanozymes (3–20 nm size) is exploited within the complex cellular environment to catalyze the oxidation of the DAB substrate, producing an electron-dense signal around the nanozyme surface, upon osmium staining. It is proved that such nanozyme amplification can achieve a catalytic signal enhancement up to 10-fold, enabling the quick detection of the Pt particles (even of 3 nm size) by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) also at low magnification and across wide fields of view in the intricate intracellular milieu. The developed procedure is ideally suited to overcome standard amplification strategies currently used in TEM analysis, such as gold or silver enhancements. Furthermore, the wide versatility of the Pt-nanozyme probes in TEM imaging is demonstrated in immuno-EM and protein trafficking studies, showing their potential to track the subcellular localization of target biomolecules at both low and high magnifications. These results suggest that the use of nanozymes might represent a paradigm shift in the conventional amplification systems currently employed in electron microscopy for cellular analyses, offering enhanced imaging capabilities.. 2024\n",

            "A simple generalization of Geršgorin's theorem. It is well known that the spectrum of a given matrix A belongs to the Geršgorin set Γ(A), as well as to the Geršgorin set applied to the transpose of A, Γ(AT). So, the spectrum belongs to their intersection. But, if we first intersect i-th Geršgorin disk Γi(A) with the corresponding disk Γi(AT) and then we make union of such intersections, which are, in fact, the smaller disks of each pair, what we get is not an eigenvalue localization area. The question is what should be added in order to catch all the eigenvalues, while, of course, staying within the set Γ(A) ∩ Γ(AT). The answer lies in the appropriate characterization of some subclasses of nonsingular H-matrices. In this paper we give two such characterizations, and then we use them to prove localization areas that answer this question. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.. 2011\n",
            "Hybrid Probabilistic Trajectory Optimization Using Null-Space Exploration. In the context of learning from demonstration, human examples are usually imitated in either Cartesian or joint space. However, this treatment might result in undesired movement trajectories in either space. This is particularly important for motion skills such as striking, which typically imposes motion constraints in both spaces. In order to address this issue, we consider a probabilistic formulation of dynamic movement primitives, and apply it to adapt trajectories in Cartesian and joint spaces simultaneously. The probabilistic treatment allows the robot to capture the variability of multiple demonstrations and facilitates the mixture of trajectory constraints from both spaces. In addition to this proposed hybrid space learning, the robot often needs to consider additional constraints such as motion smoothness and joint limits. On the basis of Jacobian-based inverse kinematics, we propose to exploit robot null-space so as to unify trajectory constraints from Cartesian and joint spaces while satisfying additional constraints. Evaluations of hand-shaking and striking tasks carried out with a humanoid robot demonstrate the applicability of our approach.. 2018\n",

In this work we introduced a prioritized Cartesian impedance control under the framework of the Quadratic Programming (QP) optimization. In particular, we present a formulation which is simpler than full inverse dynamics, avoids any matrix pseudo-inversion, inverse kinematics computation and considers strict priorities among tasks. Our formulation is based on QP optimization permitting to take into account also explicit inequality constraints. We compare in simulation the tracking results obtained with a classical algebraic implementation against those derived from the proposed QP implementation taking into account joint torque limits. We consider the classical Cartesian impedance controller and a simplified version, also known as Virtual Model Control. Finally the proposed method was implemented and validated on a humanoid upper-body torque controlled robot. Experimental trials involving various physical interaction conditions were executed to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method.. 2018\n",

            "Ciprofloxacin carrier systems based on hectorite/halloysite hybrid hydrogels for potential wound healing applications. The design of multifunctional nanomaterials which can help the healing processes of skin, preventing the bacterial infections, is crucial for the development of suitable therapy for the treatment of chronic lesions. The use of clay minerals in wound healing applications is well documented since the prehistoric period and offers several advantages due to their intrinsic properties. Herein, we report the development of ciprofloxacin carrier systems based on hectorite/halloysite (Ht/Hal) hybrid hydrogels for potential wound healing applications. To achieve this objective firstly the ciprofloxacin molecules were loaded onto Hal by a supramolecular and covalent approach. The so obtained fillers were thoroughly investigated by several techniques and at molecular level by means of quantum mechanics calculations along with empirical interatomic potentials. Afterwards the modified Hal were used as filler for Ht hydrogels. The introduction of modified Hal, in hectorite hydrogel, helps the gel formation with an improvement of the rheological properties. The in vitro kinetic release from both the fillers and from the hybrid hydrogels was studied both at skin's pH (5.4) and under neutral conditions (pH 7.4); in addition, the factors controlling the ciprofloxacin release process were determined and discussed. Finally, the in vitro biocompatibility of the Hal fillers was evaluated by means of cytotoxic assays and laser scanning confocal microscopy on normal human dermal fibroblasts.. 2021\n",
            "Biobased, Biodegradable, Self-Healing Boronic Ester Vitrimers from Epoxidized Soybean Oil Acrylate. The global production of thermosets has been increasing in recent years causing rapid consumption of fossil-based feedstocks and contributing to the plastic waste accumulation in the environment, especially because they cannot be easily reprocessed or recycled at the end of their lifetime. These drawbacks can only be overcome with the development of environmentally friendly, recyclable thermosets from renewable resources. For this reason, we present a facile way to produce a biobased reprocessable thermoset, a vitrimer, by thiol-acrylate coupling between epoxidized soybean oil acrylate and a diboronic ester dithiol dynamic cross-linker. The synthesis of the cross-linker and all the processes for the production of the vitrimer has been done following green chemistry principles. The developed vitrimer material can be reprocessed multiple times like a thermoplastic, without compromising its mechanical properties. Moreover, it can be conveniently recycled by reversible hydrolysis in 90% ethanol and subsequent solvent evaporation, regenerating the original vitrimer. An important advantage of the developed material, especially regarding its applications, is that it is able to self-repair mechanical abrasion-related defects, like scratches and cuts, at room temperature, thanks to the low glass transition temperature and rapid boronic ester exchange, which enables it to demonstrate great potential as a self-healing coating. In case of an accidental release into the environment, it is able to biodegrade, solving the problem of waste accumulation.. 2021\n",
            "Anger superiority effect: The importance of dynamic emotional facial expressions. A rapid response to a threatening face in a crowd is important to successfully interact in social environments. Visual search tasks have been employed to determine whether there is a processing advantage for detecting an angry face in a crowd, compared to a happy face. The empirical findings supporting the \"anger superiority effect\" (ASE), however, have been criticized on the basis of possible low-level visual confounds and because of the limited ecological validity of the stimuli. Moreover, a \"happiness superiority effect\" is usually found with more realistic stimuli. In the present study, we tested the ASE by using dynamic (and static) images of realistic human faces, with validated emotional expressions having similar intensities, after controlling the bottom-up visual saliency and the amount of image motion. In five experiments, we found strong evidence for an ASE when using dynamic displays of facial expressions, but not when the emotions were expressed by static face images. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.. 2013\n",

We extend the classical Mercer theorem to reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces whose elements are functions from a measurable space X into Cn. Given a finite measure μ on X, we represent the reproducing kernel K as a convergent series in terms of the eigenfunctions of a suitable compact operator depending on K and μ. Our result holds under the mild assumption that K is measurable and the associated Hilbert space is separable. Furthermore, we show that X has a natural second countable topology with respect to which the eigenfunctions are continuous and such that the series representing K uniformly converges to K on compact subsets of X×X, provided that the support of μ is X. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.. 2013\n",

            "Effect of copper on extracellular levels of key pro-inflammatory molecules in hypothalamic GN11 and primary neurons. Copper dyshomeostasis is responsible for the neurological symptoms observed in the genetically inherited copper-dependent disorders (e.g., Menkes' and Wilson's diseases), but it has been also shown to have an important role in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer disease, prion diseases, Parkinson's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. It is widely accepted that increased extracellular copper levels contribute to neuronal pathogenic process by increasing the production of dangerous radical oxygen species, but the existence of other molecular mechanisms explaining copper neurotoxicity has not been investigated yet. By using a cellular model based on hypothalamic GN11 cultured neurons exposed to copper supplementation and by analysing the cell conditioned media, we try here to identify new molecular events explaining the association between extracellular copper accumulation and neuronal damages. We show here that increased extracellular copper levels produce a wide complex of alterations in the neuronal extracellular environment. In particular, copper affects the secretion of molecules involved in the protection of neurons against oxidative stress, such as cyclophilin A (CypA), or of molecules capable of shifting neuronal cells towards a pro-inflammatory state, such as IL-1α, IL-12, Rantes, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) and secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC).

Programming and executing a subsequent move is inherently linked to the ability to anticipate the actions of others when interacting. Such fundamental social ability is particularly important in sport. Here, we discuss the possible mechanisms behind the highly sophisticated anticipation skills that characterize experts. We contend that prediction in sports might rely on a finely tuned perceptual system that endows experts with a fast, partially unconscious, pickup of relevant cues. Furthermore, we discuss the role of the multimodal, perceptuomotor, multiple-duty cells (mirror neurons) that play an important function in action anticipation by means of an inner motor simulation process. Finally, we suggest the role of predictive coding, interoception, and the enteric nervous system as the processual and biological support for intuition and “gut feelings” in sports—the missing link that might explain outstanding expert performance based on action anticipation.. 2017\n",
            "Practical motion segmentation for urban street view scenes. Though a long-studied problem, motion segmentation has yet to migrate into practical applications. We argue that a vital step towards that goal lies in addressing motion segmentation for the specific setting of interest. To this end, this paper presents a new approach for image-based motion segmentation in the case of vehicles navigating inside an urban environment. We exploit two application-specific factors - the restricted camera movement and the known type of moving objects - to deal with the two major limiting factors - missing data and strong perspective effects - that affect most previous 'generic' motion segmentation algorithms. By constraining the geometry and exploiting known semantic classes in the scene, we achieve much higher accuracy than previous approaches. In addition to the novel algorithm, we contribute a more realistic motion segmentation benchmark dataset for moving platforms by annotating real video sequences from the KITTI dataset. Experiments on this dataset and other synthetic data confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach.. 2018\n",

            "Unsupervised Detection of White Matter Fiber Bundles with Stochastic Neural Networks. Exploring the human structural connectome often involves dealing with millions of white matter tracts reconstructed from diffusion MRI. Reducing the dimensionality of such data by grouping tracts into bundles can prove essential for subsequent analyses. Many unsupervised clustering algorithms aim at providing such bundles but often require the choice of a distance metric and suffer from memory storage issues relating to the size of the datasets. We propose for the first time a neural network approach for the unsupervised clustering of white matter tracts. It has the main properties of learning automatically the tract features and scaling well with the data size. As a proof of concept, we compare both quantitatively and qualitatively the computed tract clusters with a commonly used clustering method.

            "Reliable multiplex semi-local random walk based on influential nodes to improve link prediction in complex networks. In recent years, the exponential growth of online social networks as complex networks has presented challenges in expanding networks and forging new connections. Link prediction emerges as a crucial technique to anticipate future relationships among users, leveraging the current network state to address this challenge effectively. While link prediction models on monoplex networks have a well-established history, the exploration of similar tasks on multilayer networks has garnered considerable attention. Extracting topological and multimodal features for weighting links can improve link prediction in weighted complex networks. Meanwhile, establishing reliable and trustworthy paths between users is a useful way to create metrics that convert unweighted to weighted similarity. The local random walk is a widely used technique for predicting links in weighted monoplex networks. The aim of this paper is to develop a semi-local random walk over reliable paths to improve link prediction on a multilayer social network as a complex network, which is denoted as Reliable Multiplex semi-Local Random Walk (RMLRW). RMLRW leverages the semi-local random walk technique over reliable paths, integrating intra-layer and inter-layer information from multiplex features to conduct a trustworthy biased random walk for predicting new links within a target layer of multilayer networks. In order to make RMLRW scalable, we develop a semi-local random walk-based network embedding to represent the network in a lower-dimensional space while preserving its original characteristics. Extensive experimental studies on several real-world multilayer networks demonstrate the performance assurance of RMLRW compared to equivalent methods. Specifically, RMLRW improves the average f-measure of the link prediction by 3.2% and 2.5% compared to SEM-Path and MLRW, respectively.. 2024\n",
            "Investigating low birth weight and preterm birth as potential mediators in the relationship between prenatal infections and early child development: A linked administrative health data analysis. Background: Prenatal infections are associated with childhood developmental outcomes such as reduced cognitive abilities, emotional problems and other developmental vulnerabilities. However, there is currently a lack of research examining whether this arises due to potential intermediary variables like low birth weight or preterm birth, or due to some other mechanisms of maternal immune activation arising from prenatal infections. Methods: Administrative data from the National Health Service health board of Greater Glasgow & Clyde, Scotland, were used, linking birth records to hospital records and universal child health review records for 55 534 children born from 2011 to 2015, and their mothers. Causal mediation analysis was conducted to examine the extent to which low birth weight and preterm birth mediate the relationship between hospital-diagnosed prenatal infections and having developmental concern(s) identified by a health visitor during 6-8 weeks or 27-30 months child health reviews. Results: Model estimates suggest that 5.18% (95% CI 3.77% to 7.65%) of the positive association observed between hospital-diagnosed prenatal infections and developmental concern(s) was mediated by low birth weight, while 7.37% (95% CI 5.36 to 10.88%) was mediated by preterm birth. Conclusion: Low birth weight and preterm birth appear to mediate the relationship between prenatal infections and childhood development, but only to a small extent. Maternal immune activation mechanisms unrelated to low birth weight and preterm birth remain the most likely explanation for associations observed between prenatal infections and child developmental outcomes, although other factors (for example, genetic factors) may also be involved.. 2024\n",
            "Spectral behaviour of the two-photon absorption coefficient in ZnO, CuCl and Bi4Ge3O12. The spectral behaviour of the direct interband two-photon absorption coefficient α(2) in ZnO, CuCl and Bi4Ge3O12 has been investigated in a large excitation energy range. The experimental results have shown that the α(2) spectral behaviour is well described by a parametric formula containing terms with different energy dependence. In particular, for 2h{combining short stroke overlay}ω-E g>≈400 meV, the first experimental evidence of 2h{combining short stroke overlay}ω-E g)5/2 dependence has been obtained. As a consequence, each of the various models proposed to predict the α(2) dispersion curve gives the correct energy dependence in a limited energy range, due to the poor approximation made in the evaluation of dipole matrix elements. To explain the spectral dependence of the two-photon absorption coefficient, consideration of all the intermediate states is required, with the energy dependence of the dipole matrix elements properly considered. It is shown that the greatest contributions to the oscillator strength come from transitions totally allowed at the critical points. © 1987 Società Italiana di Fisica.. 1987\n",

A single use graphite screen-printed electrode (GSPE) was easily modified, to take advantage of the proven affinity of the nontoxic post-transition metal bismuth (Bi), for metal ions to be detected by Square Wave Anodic Stripping Voltammetry (SWASV). A bismuth oxide (Bi2O3) or a chitosan coated (CS@Bi2O3) nanopowder suspension was drop-casted on the graphite working electrode (WE) surface, giving rise to the precursor of a Bi-modified GSPE. After that, an electrochemical reduction was performed to obtain the Bi– or the CS@Bi–GSPE. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and micro-X-ray fluorescence investigations were performed on the graphitic structure pre and post modification. The bismuth oxide deposition amount was considered as critical parameter to sensor performance, indicating a minimum and maximum threshold. Under improved measurement conditions, with a 300 s pre-concentration time, the attained sensors exhibited a linearity in the range (2.0–20.0) μg L−1 in the simultaneous analysis of Pb(II) and Cd(II).

Single Particle Tracking (SPT) is a technique used to locate fluorescent particles with nanometer precision. In the orbital tracking method the position of a particle is obtained analyzing the distribution of intensity along a circular orbit scanned around the particle. In combination with an active feedback this method allows tracking of particles in 2D and 3D with millisecond temporal resolution.

The commercial microscope offers the advantage of a user-friendly software interface and pre-calibrated hardware components. The use of an external piezo-scanner allows the addition of feedback into the system but also represents a limitation in terms of its mechanical response.

Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) has probably been one of the most utilized pharmaceutical polymers with applications ranging from a blood plasma substitute to nanoparticle drug delivery, since its synthesis in 1939. It is a highly biocompatible, non-toxic and transparent film forming polymer. Although high solubility of PVP in aqueous environment is advantageous, it still poses several problems for some applications in which sustained targeting and release are needed or hydrophobic drug inclusion and delivery systems are to be designed. In this study, we demonstrate that a common dietary phenolic antioxidant, p-coumaric acid (PCA), can be combined with PVP covering a wide range of molar ratios by solution blending in ethanol, forming new transparent biomaterial films with antiseptic and antioxidant properties. PCA not only acts as an effective natural plasticizer but also establishes H-bonds with PVP increasing its resistance to water dissolution. PCA could be released in a sustained manner up to a period of 3 days depending on the PVP/PCA molar ratio. Sustained drug delivery potential of the films was studied using methylene blue and carminic acid as model drugs, indicating that the release can be controlled. Antioxidant and remodeling properties of the films were evaluated in vitro by free radical cation scavenging assay and in vivo on a murine model, respectively. Furthermore, the material resorption of films was slower as PCA concentration increased, as observed from the in vivo full-thickness excision model. Finally, the antibacterial activity of the films against common pathogens such as Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus and the effective reduction of inflammatory agents such as matrix metallopeptidases were demonstrated. All these properties suggest that these new transparent PVP/PCA films can find a plethora of applications in pharmaceutical sciences including skin and wound care.. 2019\n",
            "Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation in Speech and Language Research. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), as we use it today, was developed in the 1980s, and already in the 1990s, it was clear it would became an essential tool to study human brain functions. The present chapter focuses on the technical challenges that are specific to the use of TMS in speech and language research. A section is devoted to the co-registration of TMS and electroencephalography (EEG), highlighting the great potential as well and the challenges inherent in the integration of these two techniques. The chapter briefly revises the extensive literature using TMS in speech and language research by separating the different available protocols. In particular, trains of TMS pulses can transiently interfere with the activity of a relatively specific cortical target. This approach, often named “virtual lesion approach,” has been used to investigate the role of posterior and anterior language brain areas in receptive and production tasks, respectively. Otherwise, single or paired-pulse protocols measure neurophysiological indexes of intracortical or corticomotor excitability. In this respect, TMS research has shown a specific motor recruitment during speech perception tasks, suggesting a tight functional relationship between production and perception mechanisms. In conclusion, we provide key methodological and technical suggestions on how to best approach the design of TMS studies, based on this relatively mature field of research.. 2023\n",
            "Binding mechanism of the farnesoid X receptor marine antagonist suvanine reveals a strategy to forestall drug modulation on nuclear receptors. Design, synthesis, and biological evaluation of novel ligands. Here, we report suvanine, a marine sponge sesterterpene, as an antagonist of the mammalian bile acid sensor farnesoid-X-receptor (FXR). Using suvanine as a template, we shed light on the molecular bases of FXR antagonism, identifying the essential conformational changes responsible for the transition from the agonist to the antagonist form. Molecular characterization of the nuclear corepressor NCoR and coactivator Src-1 revealed that receptor conformational changes are associated with a specific dynamic of recruitment of these cofactors to the promoter of OSTα, a FXR regulated gene. Using suvanine as a novel hit, a library of semisynthetic derivatives has been designed and prepared, leading to pharmacological profiles ranging from agonism to antagonism toward FXR. Deep pharmacological evaluation demonstrated that derivative 19 represents a new chemotype of FXR modulator, whereas alcohol 6, with a simplified molecular scaffold, exhibits excellent antagonistic activity. © 2013 American Chemical Society.. 2013\n",
            "A data-driven kinematic model of the human hand with soft-tissue artifact compensation mechanism for grasp synergy analysis. This paper presents a methodology to accurately record human finger postures during grasping. The main contribution consists of a kinematic model of the human hand reconstructed via magnetic resonance imaging of one subject that (i) is fully parameterized and can be adapted to different subjects, and (ii) is amenable to in-vivo joint angle recordings via optical tracking of markers attached to the skin. The principal novelty here is the introduction of a soft-tissue artifact compensation mechanism that can be optimally calibrated in a systematic way. The high-quality data gathered are employed to study the properties of hand postural synergies in humans, for the sake of ongoing neuroscience investigations. These data are analyzed and some comparisons with similar studies are reported. After a meaningful mapping strategy has been devised, these data could be employed to define robotic hand postures suitable to attain effective grasps, or could be used as prior knowledge in lower-dimensional, real-time avatar hand animation. © 2013 IEEE.. 2013\n",

            "Measuring g with a beam of antihydrogen (AEgIS). The gravitational interaction between matter and antimatter has never been tested experimentally. According to some attempts to unify gravity with the other forces, the possibility that g(p) & g(p¯) cannot be excluded 1. The AEGIS experiment2intends to measure for the first time the gravitational acceleration of antimatter using cold antihydrogen atoms. Antihydrogen atoms will be obtained trough a charge exchange process between Rydberg positronium atoms and antiprotons. Once H are accelerated to form a horizontal beam, they travel through a Moiré deflectometer, able to measure the vertical displacement of atoms due to gravity. Knowing the velocity of the antiatoms from the time of flight measurement and the length of the flight path allows to estimate the gravity acceleration g for antihydrogen. With this setup an initial precision on the measure of g of 1% is expected.. 2011\n",
            "Evaluating Polyacrylic Acid as a Universal Aqueous Binder for Ni-Rich Cathodes NMC811 and Si Anodes in Full Cell Lithium-ion Batteries. Silicon (Si) and silicon/graphite (Si/Gr) composite anodes are promising candidates due to their high theoretical capacity, low operating potential and natural abundance for high energy density Li-ion batteries. Green electrode production, eliminating organic volatile solvents require advancement of aqueous electrodes. Engineering the binder plays a critical role for improving waterborne electrodes. Lithium substituted polyacrylic acid LiPAA has been demonstrated as a promising binder for Si/Gr anodes and for Ni-rich cathodes in different cell configurations. LiPAA is utilized to minimize the volume expansion during cycling for Si/Gr anodes. LiPAA is formed in situ during cathode slurry preparation to regulate the pH and dimmish the Li loss. Using advanced characterization techniques, we investigated the slurries, electrodes, and active material reaction with LiPAA and its effect to the cycling performance. Our results indicate that the performance of high Si containing anode is limited by the amount of Si in the electrode. The failure mechanism with respect to high Si content was studied thoroughly. Aqueous processed cathodes with LiPAA binder in combination with Si anodes outperformed NMP based cathodes. Hence, LiPAA was successfully utilized as an active binder for both a high Si containing anode and for a Ni rich cathode.. 2024\n",

We show that the symmetry of the yellow exciton results in unusual selection rules for the optical absorption of polarized light and that the mixing of ortho- and para- excitons in magnetic field is important. The calculation of the energies of the yellow exciton series in strong and weak magnetic field limits suggests that a broad n = 2 line is comprized by two closely overlapping lines, gives a good fit to experimental data and allows to interpret the complex structure of excitonic levels.. 2018\n",

However, it is largely unclear how triplication of a small gene subset may impinge on diverse aspects of DS brain physiopathology. Here, we took a multi-omic approach and simultaneously analyzed by RNA-seq and proteomics the expression signatures of two diverse regions of human postmortem DS brains. We found that the overexpression of triplicated genes triggered global expression dysregulation, differentially affecting transcripts, miRNAs, and proteins involved in both known and novel biological candidate pathways. Among the latter, we observed an alteration in RNA splicing, specifically modulating the expression of genes involved in cytoskeleton and axonal dynamics in DS brains. Accordingly, we found an alteration in axonal polarization in neurons from DS human iPSCs and mice.

Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) have found a potential application in various domains such as gas storage/separation, drug delivery, catalysis, etc. Recently, they have found considerable attention for energy storage applications such as Li- and Na-ion batteries. However, the development of MOFs is plagued by their limited energy density that arises from high molecular weight and low volumetric density. The choice of ligand plays a crucial role in determining the performance of the MOFs. Here, we report a nickel-based one-dimensional metal-organic framework, NiC4H2O4, built from bidentate fumarate ligands for anode application in Li-ion batteries. The material was obtained by a simple chimie douce precipitation method using nickel acetate and fumaric acid. Moreover, a composite material of the MOF with reduced graphene oxide (rGO) was prepared to enhance the lithium storage performance as the rGO can enhance the electronic conductivity. Electrochemical lithium storage in the framework and the effect of rGO on the performance have been investigated by cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge–discharge measurements, and EIS studies.

            "In vivo targeting of cutaneous melanoma using an melanoma stimulating hormone-engineered human protein cage with fluorophore and magnetic resonance imaging tracers. Nanoparticle (NP)-based materials are promising agents for enhancing cancer diagnosis and treatment. Once functionalized for selective targeting of tumor-expressed molecules, they can specifically deliver drugs and diagnostic molecules inside tumor cells. In the present work, we evaluated the in vivo melanoma-targeting ability of a nanovector (HFt-MSHPEG) based on human protein ferritin (HFt), functionalized with both melanoma-targeting melanoma stimulating hormone (α-MSH) and stabilizing poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) molecules. Independent and complementary techniques, such as whole-specimen confocal microscopy and magnetic resonance imaging, were used to detect in vivo localization of NP constructs with suitable tracers (i.e., fluorophores or magnetic metals). Targeted HFt-MSH-PEG NPs accumulated persistently at the level of primary melanoma and with high selectivity with respect to other organs. Melanoma localization of untargeted HFt-PEG NPs, which lack the α-MSH moiety, was less pronounced. Furthermore, HFt-MSH-PEG NPs accumulated to a significantly lower extent and with a different distribution in a diverse type of tumor (TS/A adenocarcinoma), which does not express α-MSH receptors. Finally, in a spontaneous lung metastasis model, HFt-MSH-PEG NPs localized at the metastasis level as well. These results suggest that HFt-MSH-PEG NPs are suitable carriers for selective in vivo delivery of diagnostic or therapeutic agents to cutaneous melanoma.. 2015\n",

Complex network response to node loss is a central question in different fields of science ranging from physics, sociology, biology to ecology. Previous studies considered binary networks where the weight of the links is not accounted for. However, in real-world networks the weights of connections can be widely different. Here, we analyzed the response of real-world road traffic complex network of Beijing, the most prosperous city in China. We produced nodes removal attack simulations using classic binary node features and we introduced weighted ranks for node importance. We measured the network functioning during nodes removal with three different parameters: the size of the largest connected cluster (LCC), the binary network efficiency (Bin EFF) and the weighted network efficiency (Weg EFF). We find that removing nodes according to weighted rank, i.e. considering the weight of the links as a number of taxi flows along the roads, produced in general the highest damage in the system. Our results show that: (i) in order to model Beijing road complex networks response to nodes (intersections) failure, it is necessary to consider the weight of the links; (ii) to discover the best attack strategy, it is important to use nodes rank accounting links weight.. 2018\n",

The combination of photoacoustic imaging (PAI) and photothermal therapy (PTT) is an attractive approach in cancer management due to the non-invasive features combined with real-time imaging and selective tissue damage by non-ionizing radiation. This approach is especially appealing for Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC) management, where up to 40% of patients require modifications of the treatment regimen. On the other hand, most of the agents developed for PAI/PTT suffer from persistence or re-shaping issues. Here, a unique non-persistent plasmon nano-architecture (tNAs-IRDye) is presented that simultaneously acts as a contrast agent for PAI and as a photothermal transducer for PTT. The tNAs-IRDye are fully characterized and evaluated in vitro and ex vivo, and their performance as theranostic agents is assessed in HPV-negative HNSCC murine models. A significant modulation of tumor growth is obtained in vivo upon intratumoral injection of tNAs-IRDye and subsequent NIR irradiation compared to the solely irradiated control.

In this work, we report the synthesis of an active material for supercapacitors (SCs), namely α-Fe2O3/carbon composite (C-Fe2O3) made of elongated nanoparticles linearly connected into a worm-like morphology, by means of electrospinning followed by a calcination/carbonization process. The resulting active material powder can be directly processed in the form of slurry to produce SC electrodes with mass loadings higher than 1 mg cm−2 on practical flat current collectors, avoiding the need for bulky porous substrate, as often reported in the literature. In aqueous electrolyte (6 M KOH), the so-produced C-Fe2O3 electrodes display capacity as high as ~140 mAh g−1 at a scan rate of 2 mV s−1, while showing an optimal rate capability (capacity of 32.4 mAh g−1 at a scan rate of 400 mV s−1). Thanks to their poor catalytic activity towards water splitting reactions, the electrode can operate in a wide potential range (−1.6 V–0.3 V vs. Hg/HgO), enabling the realization of performant quasi-symmetric SCs based on electrodes with the same chemical composition (but different active material mass loadings), achieving energy density approaching 10 Wh kg−1 in aqueous electrolytes.. 2022\n",

An intriguing observation is that a colloidal suspension of ZnO nanoparticles in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) exhibits reconfiguration when exposed to electrical stimulation and produces spikes of electrical potential in response. This study presents a novel laboratory prototype of a ZnO colloidal computer, showcasing its capability to implement various Boolean functions featuring two, four and eight inputs. During our experiments, we input binary strings into the colloid mixture, where a logical 'True' state is represented by an impulse of an electrical potential. In contrast, the absence of the electrical impulse denotes a logical 'False' state. The electrical responses of the colloid mixture are recorded, allowing us to extract truth tables from the recordings. Through this methodological approach, we demonstrate the successful implementation of a wide range of logical functions using colloidal mixtures. We provide detailed distributions of the logical functions discovered and offer speculation on the potential impacts of our findings on future and emerging unconventional computing technologies.

The classic computational scheme of convolutional layers leverages filter banks that are shared over all the spatial coordinates of the input, independently on external information on what is specifically under observation and without any distinctions between what is closer to the observed area and what is peripheral. In this paper we propose to go beyond such a scheme, introducing the notion of Foveated Convolutional Layer (FCL), that formalizes the idea of location-dependent convolutions with foveated processing, i.e., fine-grained processing in a given-focused area and coarser processing in the peripheral regions. We show how the idea of foveated computations can be exploited not only as a filtering mechanism, but also as a mean to speed-up inference with respect to classic convolutional layers, allowing the user to select the appropriate trade-off between level of detail and computational burden. FCLs can be stacked into neural architectures and we evaluate them in several tasks, showing how they efficiently handle the information in the peripheral regions, eventually avoiding the development of misleading biases. When integrated with a model of human attention, FCL-based networks naturally implement a foveated visual system that guides the attention toward the locations of interest, as we experimentally analyze on a stream of visual stimuli.. 2023\n",

However, in 2D perovskites, the complicated interplay between organic spacers and inorganic slabs makes structural analysis challenging to interpret. A deeper understanding of the structure–property relationship in these systems is urgently needed to enable high-performance tunable optoelectronic devices. Herein, this study examines how structural changes, from constant lattice distortion and variable structural evolution, modeled with both static and dynamic structural descriptors, affect macroscopic properties and ultimately device performance. The effect of chemical composition, crystallographic inhomogeneity, and mechanical-stress-induced static structural changes and corresponding electronic band variations is reported. In addition, the structure dynamics are described from the viewpoint of anharmonic vibrations, which impact electron–phonon coupling and the carriers’ dynamic processes. Correlated carrier–matter interactions, known as polarons and acting on fine electronic structures, are then discussed. Finally, reliable guidelines to facilitate design to exploit structural features and rationally achieve breakthroughs in 2D perovskite applications are proposed.

            "Combining Transition Path Sampling with Data-Driven Collective Variables through a Reactivity-Biased Shooting Algorithm. Rare event sampling is a central problem in modern computational chemistry research. Among the existing methods, transition path sampling (TPS) can generate unbiased representations of reaction processes. However, its efficiency depends on the ability to generate reactive trial paths, which in turn depends on the quality of the shooting algorithm used. We propose a new algorithm based on the shooting success rate, i.e., reactivity, measured as a function of a reduced set of collective variables (CVs). These variables are extracted with a machine learning approach directly from TPS simulations, using a multitask objective function. Iteratively, this workflow significantly improves the shooting efficiency without any prior knowledge of the process. In addition, the optimized CVs can be used with biased enhanced sampling methodologies to accurately reconstruct the free energy profiles. We tested the method on three different systems: a two-dimensional toy model, conformational transitions of alanine dipeptide, and hydrolysis of acetyl chloride in bulk water. In the latter, we integrated our workflow with an active learning scheme to learn a reactive machine learning-based potential, which allowed us to study the mechanism and free energy profile with an ab initio-like accuracy.. 2024\n",
            "Disulfide-Mediated Bioconjugation: Disulfide Formation and Restructuring on the Surface of Nanomanufactured (Microfluidics) Nanoparticles. This study is about (1) nanomanufacturing (focusing on microfluidic-assisted nanoprecipitation), (2) advanced colloid characterization (focusing on field flow fractionation), and (3) the possible restructuring of surface disulfides. Disulfides are dynamic and exchangeable groups, and here we specifically focus, first, on their use to introduce biofunctional groups and, second, on their re-organization, which may lead to variable surface chemistries and uncontrolled cell interactions. The particles were obtained via microfluidic-assisted (flow-focused) nanoprecipitation of poly(ethylene glycol)-b-poly(ϵ-caprolactone) bearing or not a 2-pyridyl disulfide (PDS) terminal group, which quantitatively exchanges with thiols in solution. In this study, we have paid specific attention to size characterization, thereby also demonstrating the limitations of dynamic light scattering (DLS) as a stand-alone technique. By using asymmetric flow field flow fractionation coupled with DLS, static light scattering (SLS), and refractive index detectors, we show that relatively small amounts of >100 nm aggregates (cryogenic transmission electron microscopy and SLS/DLS comparison suggesting them to be wormlike micelles) dominated the stand-alone DLS results, whereas the \"real\" size distributions picked <50 nm. Our key result is that the kinetics of the conjugation based on PDS-thiol exchange was controlled by the thiol pKa, and this also determined the rate of the exchange between the resulting disulfides and glutathione (GSH). In particular, more acidic thiols (e.g., peptides, where a cysteine is flanked by cationic residues) react faster with PDS, but their disulfides hardly exchange with GSH; the reverse applies to thiols with a higher pKa. Disulfides that resist against restructuring via thiol-disulfide exchange allow for a stable bioconjugation, although they may be bad news for payload release under reducing conditions. However, experiments of both thiol release and nanoparticles uptake in cells (HCT116) show that also the disulfides formed from less-acidic and, therefore, less-reactive, and more exchangeable thiols were stable for at least a few hours even in a GSH-rich (10 mM) environment; this suggests a sufficiently long stability of surface groups to achieve, for example, a cell-targeting effect.. 2019\n",

            "Daliranite, PbHgAs 2 S 5: Determination of the incommensurately modulated structure and revision of the chemical formula. The incommensurately modulated crystal structure of the mineral daliranite has been determined using 3D electron diffraction data obtained on nanocrystalline domains. Daliranite is orthorhombic with a = 21, b = 4.3, c = 9.5Å and shows modulation satellites along c. The solution of the average structure in the Pnma space group together with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy data obtained on the same domains indicate a chemical formula of PbHgAs 2 S 5, which has one S fewer than previously reported. The crystal structure of daliranite is built from columns of face-sharing PbS 8 bicapped trigonal prisms laterally connected by [2+4] Hg polyhedra and (As 3+ 2 S 5) 4- groups. The excellent quality of the electron diffraction data allows a structural model to be built for the modulated structure in superspace, which shows that the modulation is due to an alternated occupancy of a split As site.. 2019\n",
            "Aging solitons in photorefractive dipolar glasses. We study experimentally the aging of optical spatial solitons in a dipolar glass hosted by a nanodisordered sample of photorefractive potassium-sodium- tantalate-niobate (KNTN). As the system ages, the waves erratically explore varying strengths of the nonlinear response, causing them to break up and scatter. We show that this process can still lead to solitons, but in a generalized form for which the changing response is compensated by changing the normalized wave size and intensity so as to maintain fixed the optical waveform. © 2013 Optical Society of America.. 2013\n",
            "Interfacing in silico and in vitro neuronal networks. In this study, an in vitro cortical culture was stimulated according to the activity exhibited by its in silico counterpart. We connected the latter, an artificial spiking neural network (SNN), to the former, a biological network (BNN), via an open-loop (i.e. unidirectional) configuration, with the ultimate goal of establishing a closed-loop bidirectional connection in future studies. We detected network bursts in the SNN and utilized them as triggers for stimulus delivery to the BNN. We analyzed evoked BNN responses to evaluate whether the BNN activity was entrained by the SNN by correlating stimuli and BNN evoked network burst rates at different timescales. We found that this correlation was nearly constant at all timescales, but its magnitude depended on the efficacy of the stimulation source in entraining BNN activity.. 2015\n",
            "Mir-146 connects stem cell identity with metabolism and pharmacological resistance in breast cancer. Although ectopic overexpression of miRNAs can influence mammary normal and cancer stem cells (SCs/CSCs), their physiological relevance remains uncertain. Here, we show that miR-146 is relevant for SC/CSC activity. MiR-146a/b expression is high in SCs/CSCs from human/mouse primary mammary tissues, correlates with the basal-like breast cancer subtype, which typically has a high CSC content, and specifically distinguishes cells with SC/CSC identity. Loss of miR-146 reduces SC/ CSC self-renewal in vitro and compromises patient-derived xenograft tumor growth in vivo, decreasing the number of tumor-initiating cells, thus supporting its pro-oncogenic function. Transcriptional analysis in mammary SC-like cells revealed that miR-146 has pleiotropic effects, reducing adaptive response mechanisms and activating the exit from quiescent state, through a complex network of finely regulated miRNA targets related to quiescence, transcription, and one-carbon pool metabolism. Consistent with these findings, SCs/CSCs display innate resistance to anti-folate chemotherapies either in vitro or in vivo that can be reversed by miR-146 depletion, unmasking a “hidden vulnerability” exploitable for the development of anti-CSC therapies.. 2021\n",
            "Effective data-driven collective variables for free energy calculations from metadynamics of paths. A variety of enhanced sampling (ES) methods predict multidimensional free energy landscapes associated with biological and other molecular processes as a function of a few selected collective variables (CVs). The accuracy of these methods is crucially dependent on the ability of the chosen CVs to capture the relevant slow degrees of freedom of the system. For complex processes, finding such CVs is the real challenge. Machine learning (ML) CVs offer, in principle, a solution to handle this problem. However, these methods rely on the availability of high-quality datasets—ideally incorporating information about physical pathways and transition states—which are difficult to access, therefore greatly limiting their domain of application. Here, we demonstrate how these datasets can be generated by means of ES simulations in trajectory space via the metadynamics of paths algorithm. The approach is expected to provide a general and efficient way to generate efficient ML-based CVs for the fast prediction of free energy landscapes in ES simulations. We demonstrate our approach with two numerical examples, a 2D model potential and the isomerization of alanine dipeptide, using deep targeted discriminant analysis as our ML-based CV of choice.. 2024\n",
            "Discovery of CDC42 Inhibitors with a Favorable Pharmacokinetic Profile and Anticancer In Vivo Efficacy. We previously reported trisubstituted pyrimidine lead compounds, namely, ARN22089 and ARN25062, which block the interaction between CDC42 with its specific downstream effector, a PAK protein. This interaction is crucial for the progression of multiple tumor types. Such inhibitors showed anticancer efficacy in vivo. Here, we describe a second class of CDC42 inhibitors with favorable drug-like properties. Out of the 25 compounds here reported, compound 15 (ARN25499) stands out as the best lead compound with an improved pharmacokinetic profile, increased bioavailability, and efficacy in an in vivo PDX tumor mouse model. Our results indicate that these CDC42 inhibitors represent a promising chemical class toward the discovery of anticancer drugs, with ARN25499 as an additional lead candidate for preclinical development.. 2024\n",
            "Graph Neural Networks for Graph Drawing. Graph drawing techniques have been developed in the last few years with the purpose of producing esthetically pleasing node-link layouts. Recently, the employment of differentiable loss functions has paved the road to the massive usage of gradient descent and related optimization algorithms. In this article, we propose a novel framework for the development of Graph Neural Drawers (GNDs), machines that rely on neural computation for constructing efficient and complex maps. GND is Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) whose learning process can be driven by any provided loss function, such as the ones commonly employed in Graph Drawing. Moreover, we prove that this mechanism can be guided by loss functions computed by means of feedforward neural networks, on the basis of supervision hints that express beauty properties, like the minimization of crossing edges. In this context, we show that GNNs can nicely be enriched by positional features to deal also with unlabeled vertexes. We provide a proof-of-concept by constructing a loss function for the edge crossing and provide quantitative and qualitative comparisons among different GNN models working under the proposed framework.. 2024\n",
            "A Finite element model of tactile flow for softness perception. Touch is an extremely dynamic sense. To take into account this aspect, it has been hypothesized that there are mechanisms in the brain that specialize in processing dynamic tactile stimuli, in a way not too dissimilar from what happens for optical flow in dynamic vision. The concept of tactile flow, related to the rate of expansion of isostrain volumes in the human fingerpad, was used to explain some perceptual illusions as well as mechanisms of human softness perception. In this paper we describe a computational model of tactile flow, and apply it to a finite element model of interaction between deformable bodies. The shape and material properties of the bodies are modeled from those of a human fingertip interacting with specimens with different softness properties. Results show that the rate of expansion of isostrain volumes can be used to discriminate different materials in terms of their softness characteristics.. 2015\n",
            "Degeneration of cholinergic basal forebrain nuclei after focally evoked status epilepticus. Status epilepticus (SE) of limbic onset might cause degenerative phenomena in different brain structures, and may be associated with chronic cognitive and EEG effects. In the present study SE was evoked focally by microinfusing picomolar doses of cyclothiazide+bicuculline into the anterior extent of the piriform cortex (APC) in rats, the so-called area tempestas, an approach which allows to evaluate selectively the effects of seizure spreading through the natural anatomical circuitries up to secondary generalization. In the brain of rats submitted to SE we analyzed neuronal density, occurrence of degenerative phenomena (by Fluoro-Jade B-FJB- staining) and expression of heat shock protein-70 (HSP-70) in the piriform cortex, the hippocampus and ventromedial thalamus. We further analyzed in detail, the loss of cholinergic neurons, and the presence of FJB- and HSP-70 positive neurons in basal forebrain cholinergic areas, i.e. the medial septal nucleus (MSN, Ch1), the diagonal band of Broca (DBB, Ch2 and Ch3) and the Nucleus basalis of Meynert (NBM, Ch4). In fact, these nuclei are strictly connected with limbic structures, and play a key pivotal role in different cognitive functions and vigilance. Although recent studies begun to investigate these nuclei in experimental epilepsy and in persons with epilepsy, conflicting results were obtained so far. We showed that after severe and long-lasting, focally induced limbic SE there is a significant cell loss within all of the abovementioned cholinergic nuclei ipsi- and contra-laterally to the infusion site. In parallel, these nuclei show also FJB and heat shock protein-70 expression. Those effects vary depending on the single nucleus assessed and on the severity of the SE seizure score. We also showed the occurrence of cell loss and degenerative phenomena in limbic cortex, hippocampus and limbic thalamic areas. These novel findings show direct evidence of SE-induced neuronal damage which is solely due to seizure activity ruling out potential confounding effects produced by systemic pro-convulsant neurotoxins. A damage to basal forebrain cholinergic nuclei, which may underlie cognitive alterations, is documented for the first time in a model of SE triggered focally.. 2019\n",
            "A novel skin-stretch haptic device for intuitive control of robotic prostheses and avatars. Without proprioception, i.e., the intrinsic capability of a body to perceive its own limb position, completing daily life activities would require constant visual attention and it would be challenging or even impossible. This situation is similar to the one experienced after limb amputation and in robotic tele-operation, where the natural sensory-motor loop is broken. While some promising solutions based on skin stretch sensory substitution have been proposed to restore tactile properties in these conditions, there is still room for enhancing the intuitiveness of stimulus delivery and integration of haptic feedback devices within user's body. To contribute to this goal, here, we propose a wearable device based on skin stretch stimulation, the Stretch-Pro, which can provide proprioceptive information on artificial hand aperture. This system can be suitably integrated in a prosthetic socket or can be easily worn by a user controlling remote robots. The system can imitate the stretching of the skin that would naturally occur on the intact limb, when it is used to accomplish motor tasks. Two versions of the system are presented, with one and two actuators, respectively, which deliver the stretch stimulus in different ways. Experiments with able-bodied participants and a preliminary test with one prosthesis user are reported. Results suggest that Stretch-Pro could be a viable solution to convey proprioceptive cues to upper limb prosthesis users, opening promising perspectives for tele-robotics applications.. 2019\n",
            "Quantum computing algorithms: getting closer to critical problems in computational biology. The recent biotechnological progress has allowed life scientists and physicians to access an unprecedented, massive amount of data at all levels (molecular, supramolecular, cellular and so on) of biological complexity. So far, mostly classical computational efforts have been dedicated to the simulation, prediction or de novo design of biomolecules, in order to improve the understanding of their function or to develop novel therapeutics. At a higher level of complexity, the progress of omics disciplines (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics) has prompted researchers to develop informatics means to describe and annotate new biomolecules identified with a resolution down to the single cell, but also with a high-throughput speed. Machine learning approaches have been implemented to both the modelling studies and the handling of biomedical data. Quantum computing (QC) approaches hold the promise to resolve, speed up or refine the analysis of a wide range of these computational problems. Here, we review and comment on recently developed QC algorithms for biocomputing, with a particular focus on multi-scale modelling and genomic analyses. Indeed, differently from other computational approaches such as protein structure prediction, these problems have been shown to be adequately mapped onto quantum architectures, the main limit for their immediate use being the number of qubits and decoherence effects in the available quantum machines. Possible advantages over the classical counterparts are highlighted, along with a description of some hybrid classical/quantum approaches, which could be the closest to be realistically applied in biocomputation.. 2022\n",

            "Effect of structure levels on surface-enhanced Raman scattering of human telomeric G-quadruplexes in diluted and crowded media. Human telomeric G-quadruplexes are emerging targets in anticancer drug discovery since they are able to efficiently inhibit telomerase, an enzyme which is greatly involved in telomere instability and immortalization process in malignant cells. G-quadruplex (G4) DNA is highly polymorphic and can adopt different topologies upon addition of electrolytes, additives, and ligands. The study of G-quadruplex forms under various conditions, however, might be quite challenging. In this work, surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) spectroscopy has been applied to study G-quadruplexes formed by human telomeric sequences, d[A3G3(TTAGGG)3A2] (Tel26) and d[(TTAGGG)4T2] (wtTel26), under dilute and crowding conditions. The SERS spectra distinctive of hybrid-1 and hybrid-2 G-quadruplexes of Tel26 and wtTel26, respectively, were observed for the sequences folded in the presence of K+ ions (110 mM) in a buffered solution, representing the diluted medium. Polyethylene glycol (5, 10, 15, 20, and 40% v/v PEG) was used to create a molecular-crowded environment, resulting in the formation of the parallel G-quadruplexes of both studied human telomeric sequences. Despite extensive overlap by the crowding agent bands, the SERS spectral features indicative of parallel G4 form of Tel26 were recognized. The obtained results implied that SERS of G-quadruplexes reflected not only the primary structure of the studied human telomeric sequence, including its nucleobase composition and sequence, but also its secondary structure in the sense of Hoogsteen hydrogen bonds responsible for the guanine tetrad formation, and finally its tertiary structure, defining a three-dimensional DNA shape, positioned close to the enhancing metallic surface.

            "Solvent and alkyl substitution effects on charge-transfer mediated triplet state generation in BODIPY dyads: a combined computational and experimental study. Donor–acceptor dyads based on BODIPYs have been recently employed to enhance the formation of triplet excited states with the process of spin–orbit charge transfer intersystem crossing (SOCT-ISC) which does not require introduction of transition metals or other heavy atoms into the molecule. In this work we compare two donor–acceptor dyads based on meso-naphthalenyl BODIPY by combining experimental and computational investigations. The photophysical and electrochemical characterization reveals a significant effect of alkylation of the BODIPY core, disfavoring the SOCT-ISC mechanism for the ethylated BODIPY dyad. This is complemented with a computational investigation carried out to rationalize the influence of ethyl substituents and solvent effects on the electronic structure and efficiency of triplet state population via charge recombination (CR) from the photoinduced electron transfer (PeT) generated charge-transfer (CT) state. Time dependent-density functional theory (TD-DFT) calculations including solvent effects and spin–orbit coupling (SOC) calculations uncover the combined role played by solvent and alkyl substitution on the lateral positions of BODIPY.

            "Pain relief by touch: A quantitative approach. Pain relief by touch has been studied for decades in pain neuroscience. Human perceptual studies revealed analgesic effects of segmental tactile stimulation, as compared to extrasegmental touch. However, the spatial organisation of touch-pain interactions within a single human dermatome has not been investigated yet. In 2 experiments we tested whether, how, and where within a dermatome touch modulates the perception of laser-evoked pain. We measured pain perception using intensity ratings, qualitative descriptors, and signal detection measures of sensitivity and response bias. Touch concurrent with laser pulses produced a significant analgesia, and reduced the sensitivity in detecting the energy of laser stimulation, implying a functional loss of information within the ascending Aδ pathway. Touch also produced a bias to judge laser stimuli as less painful. This bias decreased linearly when the distance between the laser and tactile stimuli increased. Thus, our study provides evidence for a spatial organisation of intrasegmental touch-pain interactions. © 2013 International Association for the Study of Pain. Published by Elsevier B.V.

This paper presents a contribution to the problem of obtaining an optimal synthesis for shortest paths for a unicycle guided by an on-board limited Field-Of-View (FOV) sensor, which must keep a given landmark in sight. Previous works on this subject have provided an optimal synthesis for the case in which the FOV is limited in the horizontal directions (H-FOV, i.e., left and right boundaries). In this paper we study the complementary case in which the FOV is limited only in the vertical direction (V-FOV, i.e., upper and lower boundaries). With respect to the H-FOV case, the vertical limitation is all but a simple extension. Indeed, not only the geometry of extremal arcs is different, but also a more complex structure of the synthesis is revealed by analysis. We will indeed show that there exist initial configurations for which the optimal path does not exist. In such cases, we provide an ε-optimal path whose length approximates arbitrarily well any other shorter path. Finally, we provide a partition of the motion plane in regions such that the optimal or ε-optimal path from each point in that region is univocally determined.. 2015\n",
            "Better safe than sorry? The safety margin surrounding the body is increased by anxiety. The defensive peripersonal space represents a \"safety margin\" advantageous for survival. Its spatial extension and the possible relationship with personality traits have never been investigated. Here, in a population of 15 healthy human participants, we show that the defensive peripersonal space has a sharp boundary, located between 20 and 40cmfrom the face, and that within such space there is a thin, \"highest-risk area\" closest to the face (i.e., an \"ultra-near\" defensive space). Single-subject analysis revealed clear interindividual differences in the extension of such peripersonal space. These differences are positively related to individual variability in trait anxiety. These findings point to the potential for measuring a range of defensive behaviors in relation to individual levels of anxiety. Such measures will allow developing procedures to test risk assessment abilities, particularly in professions that require reacting quickly to aversive stimuli near the body, such as firemen, policemen, and military officers.

            "On the impact of controlled wall roughness shape on the flow of a soft material. We explore the impact of geometrical corrugations on the near-wall flow properties of a soft material driven in a confined rough microchannel. By means of numerical simulations, we perform a quantitative analysis of the relation between the flow rate Φ and the wall stress σw for a number of setups, by changing both the roughness values as well as the roughness shape. Roughness suppresses the flow, with the existence of a characteristic value of σw at which flow sets in. Just above the onset of flow, we quantitatively analyze the relation between Φ and σw. While for smooth walls a linear dependence is observed, steeper behaviours are found to set in by increasing wall roughness. The variation of the steepness, in turn, depends on the shape of the wall roughness, wherein gentle steepness changes are promoted by a variable space localization of the roughness.. 2019\n",

Low-cost manganese oxide, MnOx-based electrocatalysts, containing α-MnO2 and mixed α-Mn2O3/α-MnO2 phases, were synthesized by scalable anodic and cathodic electrodeposition methods, respectively. Their morphological and chemical composition were characterized by means of Field Emission Scanning Electronic Microscopy (FESEM), X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS). These electrodes were tested for the electro-oxidation of a recalcitrant molecule (i.e. phenol) in a lab-scale high temperature and high pressure (HTHP) batch electrocatalytic reactor. Their electrocatalytic activity was compared with that of state-of-the-art anodes for phenol electro-oxidation: antimony-doped tin oxide (SnO2–Sb5+) and ruthenium oxide (RuO2): first, under standard ambient conditions, and then, under the conditions of a Polymeric Electrolyte Membrane (PEM) electrolyzer (i.e. 85 °C and 30 bar) and of mild Catalytic Wet Air Oxidation (CWAO, i.e. 150 °C and 30 bar). Both reaction time and current density were varied to investigate their effect in the performances of the system as well as on the reaction mechanism. Both MnOx electrodes reported enhanced conversion efficiencies, up to ∼75%, at the highest pressure and temperature, and at the lowest applied current density, which influenced the process by improving dissolution of the O2 evolved, the reaction kinetics and thermodynamics, and by minimizing irreversibilities, respectively. The here reported MnOx films achieved conversion and mineralization efficiencies comparable to Sb-SnO2 (that is the more toxic) and RuO2 (that is more expensive) materials, operating under mild CWAO operation conditions, which demonstrate the potential of the electrocatalytic HTHP process as a sustainable advanced oxidation technology for wastewater treatment or electrosynthesis applications.. 2018\n",

            "Neural Time-Reversed Generalized Riccati Equation. Optimal control deals with optimization problems in which variables steer a dynamical system, and its outcome contributes to the objective function. Two classical approaches to solving these problems are Dynamic Programming and the Pontryagin Maximum Principle. In both approaches, Hamiltonian equations offer an interpretation of optimality through auxiliary variables known as costates. However, Hamiltonian equations are rarely used due to their reliance on forward-backward algorithms across the entire temporal domain. This paper introduces a novel neural-based approach to optimal control, with the aim of working forward-in-time. Neural networks are employed not only for implementing state dynamics but also for estimating costate variables. The parameters of the latter network are determined at each time step using a newly introduced local policy referred to as the time-reversed generalized Riccati equation. This policy is inspired by a result discussed in the Linear Quadratic (LQ) problem, which we conjecture stabilizes state dynamics. We support this conjecture by discussing experimental results from a range of optimal control case studies.. 2024\n",
            "Local Propagation in Constraint-based Neural Networks. In this paper we study a constraint-based representation of neural network architectures. We cast the learning problem in the Lagrangian framework and we investigate a simple optimization procedure that is well suited to fulfil the so-called architectural constraints, learning from the available supervisions. The computational structure of the proposed Local Propagation (LP) algorithm is based on the search for saddle points in the adjoint space composed of weights, neural outputs, and Lagrange multipliers. All the updates of the model variables are locally performed, so that LP is fully parallelizable over the neural units, circumventing the classic problem of gradient vanishing in deep networks. The implementation of popular neural models is described in the context of LP, together with those conditions that trace a natural connection with Backpropagation. We also investigate the setting in which we tolerate bounded violations of the architectural constraints, and we provide experimental evidence that LP is a feasible approach to train shallow and deep networks, opening the road to further investigations on more complex architectures, easily describable by constraints.. 2020\n",
            "Enhancing human-robot collaborative transportation through obstacle-aware vibrotactile warning and virtual fixtures. Transporting large and heavy objects can benefit from Human-Robot Collaboration (HRC), increasing the contribution of robots to our daily tasks and addressing challenges arising from labor shortages. This strategy typically positions the human collaborator as the leader, with the robot assuming the follower role. However, when transporting large objects, the operator’s situational awareness can be compromised as the objects may occlude different parts of the environment, weakening the human leader’s decision-making capacity and leading to failure due to collision. This paper proposes a situational awareness framework for collaborative transportation to face this challenge. The framework integrates a multi-modal haptic-based Obstacle Feedback Module with two units. The first unit consists of a warning module that alerts the operator through a haptic belt with four vibrotactile devices that provide feedback about the location and proximity of the obstacles. The second unit implements virtual fixtures as hard constraints for mobility. The warning feedback and the virtual fixtures act online based on the information given by two Lidars mounted on a mobile manipulator to detect the obstacles in the surroundings. By enhancing the operator’s awareness of the environment, the proposed module improves the safety of the human–robot team in collaborative transportation scenarios by preventing collisions. Experiments with 16 non-expert subjects in four feedback modalities during four scenarios report an objective evaluation thanks to quantitative metrics and subjective evaluations based on user-level experiences. The results reveal the strengths and weaknesses of the implemented feedback modalities while providing solid evidence of the increased situational awareness of the operator when the two haptic units are employed.. 2024\n",

A specific design allows us to couple the PVL with nanostructures placed at its center. The proposed configuration allows a simultaneous nanofocusing effect on four facing planar nanotips, showing efficient condensation of SPPs at the metal-air interface toward the end point of the tips.

This study investigates children’s trust in two humanoid robots, Nao and iCub, through a cooperative game designed to elicit spontaneous behaviors and group dynamics. We investigate whether participants change their choices after hearing advice from a robot, considering rounds where the advice is correct or incorrect, with the robot apologizing for its mistakes. Results reveal that, in most cases, participants prefer not to change their moves after the robot’s advice. Additionally, after the robots made mistakes, participants are less likely to actively follow their advice and more likely to reject it. No significant differences in strategies among the iCub and Nao samples are evidenced. Furthermore, we examine the influence of group dynamics, identifying “Proactive Players” who consistently initiated moves. A significant association between the strategies of this player and their teammates is found, suggesting potential influence.. 2025\n",
            "Continual Learning with Pretrained Backbones by Tuning in the Input Space. The intrinsic difficulty in adapting deep learning models to non-stationary environments limits the applicability of neural networks to real-world tasks. This issue is critical in practical supervised learning settings, such as the ones in which a pre-trained model computes projections toward a latent space where different task predictors are sequentially learned over time. As a matter of fact, incrementally fine-tuning the whole model to better adapt to new tasks usually results in catastrophic forgetting, with decreasing performance over the past experiences and losing valuable knowledge from the pretraining stage. In this paper, we propose a novel strategy to make the fine-tuning procedure more effective, by avoiding to update the pre-trained part of the network and learning not only the usual classification head, but also a set of newly-introduced learnable parameters that are responsible for transforming the input data. This process allows the network to effectively leverage the pre-training knowledge and find a good trade-off between plasticity and stability with modest computational efforts, thus especially suitable for on-the-edge settings. Our experiments on four image classification problems in a continual learning setting confirm the quality of the proposed approach when compared to several fine-tuning procedures and to popular continual learning methods.. 2023\n",
            "CONTINUAL LEARNING THROUGH HAMILTON EQUATIONS. Learning in a continual manner is one of the main challenges that the machine learning community is currently facing. The importance of the problem can be readily understood as soon as we consider settings where an agent is supposed to learn through an online interaction with a data stream, rather than operating offline on previously prepared data collections. In the last few years many efforts have been spent in proposing both models and algorithms to let machines learn in a continual manner, and the problem still remains extremely challenging. Many of the existing works rely on re-adapting the usual learning framework inherited from classic statistical approaches, that are typical of non-continual-learning oriented problems. In this paper we consider a fully new perspective, rethinking the methodologies to be used to tackle continual learning, instead of re-adapting offline-oriented optimization. In particular, we propose a novel method to frame continual and online learning within the framework of optimal control. The proposed formulation leads to a novel interpretation of learning dynamics in terms of Hamilton equations. As a case study for the theory, we consider the problem of unsupervised optical flow estimation from a video stream. An experimental proof of concept for this learning task is discussed with the purpose of illustrating the soundness of the proposed approach, and opening to further research in this direction.. 2022\n",

            "Pinprick-evoked brain potentials: A novel tool to assess central sensitization of nociceptive pathways in humans. Although hyperalgesia to mechanical stimuli is a frequent sign in patients with inflammation or neuropathic pain, there is to date no objective electrophysiological measure for its evaluation in the clinical routine. Here we describe a technique for recording the electroencephalographic (EEG) responses elicited by mechanical stimulation with a flat-tip probe (diameter 0.25 mm, force 128 mN). Such probes activate Aδ nociceptors and are widely used to assess the presence of secondary hyperalgesia, a psychophysical correlate of sensitization in the nociceptive system. The corresponding pinprick-evoked potentials (PEPs) were recorded in 10 subjects during stimulation of the right and left hand dorsum before and after intradermal injection of capsaicin into the right hand and in 1 patient with a selective lesion of the right spinothalamic tract. PEPs in response to stimulation of normal skin were characterized by a vertex negative-positive (NP) complex, with N/P latencies and amplitudes of 111/245 ms and 3.5/11 μV, respectively. All subjects developed a robust capsaicin-induced increase in the pain elicited by pinprick stimulation of the secondary hyperalgesic area (+91.5%, P < 0.005). Such stimulation also resulted in a significant increase of the N-wave amplitude (+92.9%, P < 0.005), but not of the P wave (+6.6%, P = 0.61). In the patient, PEPs during stimulation of the hypoalgesic side were reduced. These results indicate that PEPs 1) reflect cortical activities triggered by somatosensory input transmitted in Aδ primary sensory afferents and spinothalamic projection neurons, 2) allow quantification of experimentally induced secondary mechanical hyperalgesia, and 3) have the potential to become a diagnostic tool to substantiate mechanical hyperalgesia in patients with presumed central sensitization. © 2013 the American Physiological Society.. 2013\n",

Organic Electronic platforms for biosensing are being demonstrated at a fast pace, especially in healthcare applications where the use of organic semi-conductive materials leads to devices that efficiently interface the living matter. This stems from desirable features of organic semi-conductors. Another interesting feature of organic semi-conductors, albeit usually neglected in the development of (bio-)sensors, is their capability to mimic brain synaptic plasticity phenomena such as Short-Term Plasticity - STP, upon pulsed or AC biasing. Investigation of these neural-like response resulted in the novel field of Organic Neuromorphic Electronics.  Interestingly, peculiar figures of merit of device neuromorphism are dictated by the surrounding environment and, in particular, by the ion dynamics in close proximity to the organic semi-conductors.

            "A mechanosensory feedback that uncouples external and self-generated sensory responses in the olfactory cortex. Sampling behaviors have sensory consequences that can hinder perceptual stability. In olfaction, sniffing affects early odor encoding, mimicking a sudden change in odor concentration. We examined how the inhalation speed affects the representation of odor concentration in the main olfactory cortex. Neurons combine the odor input with a global top-down signal preceding the sniff and a mechanosensory feedback generated by the air passage through the nose during inhalation. Still, the population representation of concentration is remarkably sniff invariant. This is because the mechanosensory and olfactory responses are uncorrelated within and across neurons. Thus, faster odor inhalation and an increase in concentration change the cortical activity pattern in distinct ways. This encoding strategy affords tolerance to potential concentration fluctuations caused by varying inhalation speeds. Since mechanosensory reafferences are widespread across sensory systems, the coding scheme described here may be a canonical strategy to mitigate the sensory ambiguities caused by movements.. 2024\n",
            "CONTINUAL UNSUPERVISED LEARNING FOR OPTICAL FLOW ESTIMATION WITH DEEP NETWORKS. In the last few years there has been a growing interest in approaches that allow neural networks to learn how to predict optical flow, both in a supervised and, more recently, unsupervised manner. While this clearly opens up the possibility of learning to estimate optical flow in a truly lifelong setting, by processing a potentially endless video stream, existing techniques assume to have access to large datasets and they perform stochastic mini-batch-based gradient optimization, paired with further ad-hoc components. We present an extensive study on how neural networks can learn to estimate optical flow in a continual manner while observing a long video stream and reacting online to the streamed information without any further data buffering. To this end, we rely on photo-realistic video streams that we specifically created using 3D virtual environments, as well as on a real-world movie. Our analysis considers important model selection issues that might be easily overlooked at a first glance, comparing different neural architectures and also state-of-the-art models pretrained in an offline manner. Our results not only show the feasibility of continual unsupervised learning in optical flow estimation, but also indicate that the learned models, in several situations, are comparable to state-of-the-art offline-pretrained networks. Moreover, we show how common issues in continual learning, such as catastrophic forgetting, do not affect the proposed models in a disruptive manner, given the task at hand.. 2022\n",
            "DEK oncoprotein participates in heterochromatin replication via SUMO-dependent nuclear bodies. The correct inheritance of chromatin structure is key for maintaining genome function and cell identity and preventing cellular transformation. DEK, a conserved non-histone chromatin protein, has recognized tumor-promoting properties, its overexpression being associated with poor prognosis in various cancer types. At the cellular level, DEK displays pleiotropic functions, influencing differentiation, apoptosis and stemness, but a characteristic oncogenic mechanism has remained elusive. Here, we report the identification of DEK bodies, focal assemblies of DEK that regularly occur at specific, yet unidentified, sites of heterochromatin replication exclusively in late S-phase. In these bodies, DEK localizes in direct proximity to active replisomes in agreement with a function in the early maturation of heterochromatin. A high-throughput siRNA screen, supported by mutational and biochemical analyses, identifies SUMO as one regulator of DEK body formation, linking DEK to the complex SUMO protein network that controls chromatin states and cell fate. This work combines and refines our previous data on DEK as a factor essential for heterochromatin integrity and facilitating replication under stress, and delineates an avenue of further study for unraveling the contribution of DEK to cancer development.. 2023\n",

            "Nonpersistent Nanoarchitectures Enhance Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy in an Immunocompetent Orthotopic Model of HPV+ Head/Neck Carcinoma. Cisplatin chemoradiotherapy (CRT) is the established standard of care for managing locally advanced human papillomavirus-positive head/neck carcinoma. The typically young patients may suffer serious and long-time side effects caused by the treatment, such as dysphagia, and hearing loss. Thus, ensuring a satisfactory post-treatment quality of life is paramount. One potential replacing approach to the classical CRT involves the combination of standard-dose radiotherapy and radiosensitizers such as noble metal nanoparticles (NPs). However, several concerns about size, shape, and biocompatibility limit the translation of metal nanomaterials to the clinical practice. Here, it is demonstrated that a new model of nonpersistent gold nanoarchitectures containing cisplatin (NAs-Cluster-CisPt) generates, in combination with radiotherapy, a significant in vivo tumor-reducing effect compared to the standard CRT, achieving a complete tumor clearance in 25% of the immunocompetent models that persist for 60 days. These findings, together with the negligible amount of metals recognized in the excretory organs, highlight that the concurrent administration of NAs-Cluster-CisPt and radiotherapy has the potential to overcome some clinical limitations associated to NP-based approaches while enhancing the treatment outcome with respect to standard CRT. Overall, despite further mechanistic investigations being essential, these data support the exploiting of nonpersistent metal-nanomaterial-mediated approaches for oral cancer management.. 2024\n",

            "LTR retrotransposons show low levels of unequal recombination and high rates of intraelement gene conversion in large plant genomes. The accumulation and removal of transposable elements (TEs) is a major driver of genome size evolution in eukaryotes. In plants, long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons (LTR-RTs) represent the majority of TEs and form most of the nuclear DNA in large genomes. Unequal recombination (UR) between LTRs leads to removal of intervening sequence and formation of solo-LTRs. UR is a major mechanism of LTR-RT removal in many angiosperms, but our understanding of LTR-RT-associated recombination within the large, LTR-RT-rich genomes of conifers is quite limited. We employ a novel read-based methodology to estimate the relative rates of LTR-RT-associated UR within the genomes of four conifer and seven angiosperm species. We found the lowest rates of UR in the largest genomes studied, conifers and the angiosperm maize. Recombination may also resolve as gene conversion, which does not remove sequence, so we analyzed LTR-RT-associated gene conversion events (GCEs) in Norway spruce and six angiosperms. Opposite the trend for UR, we found the highest rates of GCEs in Norway spruce and maize. Unlike previous work in angiosperms, we found no evidence that rates of UR correlate with retroelement structural features in the conifers, suggesting that another process is suppressing UR in these species. Recent results from diverse eukaryotes indicate that heterochromatin affects the resolution of recombination, by favoring gene conversion over crossing-over, similar to our observation of opposed rates of UR and GCEs. Control of LTR-RT proliferation via formation of heterochromatin would be a likely step toward large genomes in eukaryotes carrying high LTR-RT content.. 2017\n",
            "Evaluating Continual Learning Algorithms by Generating 3D Virtual Environments. Continual learning refers to the ability of humans and animals to incrementally learn over time in a given environment. Trying to simulate this learning process in machines is a challenging task, also due to the inherent difficulty in creating conditions for designing continuously evolving dynamics that are typical of the real-world. Many existing research works usually involve training and testing of virtual agents on datasets of static images or short videos, considering sequences of distinct learning tasks. However, in order to devise continual learning algorithms that operate in more realistic conditions, it is fundamental to gain access to rich, fully-customizable and controlled experimental playgrounds. Focussing on the specific case of vision, we thus propose to leverage recent advances in 3D virtual environments in order to approach the automatic generation of potentially life-long dynamic scenes with photo-realistic appearance. Scenes are composed of objects that move along variable routes with different and fully customizable timings, and randomness can also be included in their evolution. A novel element of this paper is that scenes are described in a parametric way, thus allowing the user to fully control the visual complexity of the input stream the agent perceives. These general principles are concretely implemented exploiting a recently published 3D virtual environment. The user can generate scenes without the need of having strong skills in computer graphics, since all the generation facilities are exposed through a simple high-level Python interface. We publicly share the proposed generator.. 2022\n",
            "Focus of attention improves information transfer in visual features. Unsupervised learning from continuous visual streams is a challenging problem that cannot be naturally and efficiently managed in the classic batch-mode setting of computation. The information stream must be carefully processed accordingly to an appropriate spatio-temporal distribution of the visual data, while most approaches of learning commonly assume uniform probability density. In this paper we focus on unsupervised learning for transferring visual information in a truly online setting by using a computational model that is inspired to the principle of least action in physics. The maximization of the mutual information is carried out by a temporal process which yields online estimation of the entropy terms. The model, which is based on second-order differential equations, maximizes the information transfer from the input to a discrete space of symbols related to the visual features of the input, whose computation is supported by hidden neurons. In order to better structure the input probability distribution, we use a human-like focus of attention model that, coherently with the information maximization model, is also based on second-order differential equations. We provide experimental results to support the theory by showing that the spatio-temporal filtering induced by the focus of attention allows the system to globally transfer more information from the input stream over the focused areas and, in some contexts, over the whole frames with respect to the unfiltered case that yields uniform probability distributions.. 2020\n",

This work reports the fabrication of memristive devices based on iron oxide (Fe2O3) thin films grown by atomic layer deposition (ALD) using ferrocene as iron precursor and ozone as oxidant. An excellent control of the ALD process was achieved by using an experimental procedure based on a sequence of micro-pulses, which provided long residence time and homogeneous diffusion of precursors, allowing ALD of thin films with smooth morphology and crystallinity which was found to increase with layer thickness, at temperatures as low as 250 °C. The resistive switching of symmetric Pt/Fe2O3/Pt thin film devices exhibited bipolar mode with good stability and endurance. Multi-level switching was achieved via current and voltage control. It was proved that the ON state regime can be tuned by changing the current compliance while the OFF state can be changed to intermediate levels by decreasing the maximum voltage during RESET. The structural analysis of the switched oxide layer revealed the presence of nano-sized crystalline domains corresponding to different iron oxide phases, suggesting that Joule heating effects during I-V cycling are responsible for a crystallization process of the pristine amorphous layer.. 2018\n",
            "Glycolytic-to-oxidative fiber-type switch and mTOR signaling activation are early-onset features of SBMA muscle modified by high-fat diet. Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is a neuromuscular disease caused by the expansion of a polyglutamine tract in the androgen receptor (AR). The mechanism by which expansion of polyglutamine in AR causes muscle atrophy is unknown. Here, we investigated pathological pathways underlying muscle atrophy in SBMA knock-in mice and patients. We show that glycolytic muscles were more severely affected than oxidative muscles in SBMA knock-in mice. Muscle atrophy was associated with early-onset, progressive glycolytic-to-oxidative fiber-type switch. Whole genome microarray and untargeted lipidomic analyses revealed enhanced lipid metabolism and impaired glycolysis selectively in muscle. These metabolic changes occurred before denervation and were associated with a concurrent enhancement of mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling, which induced peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1 alpha (PGC1α) expression. At later stages of disease, we detected mitochondrial membrane depolarization, enhanced transcription factor EB (TFEB) expression and autophagy, and mTOR-induced protein synthesis. Several of these abnormalities were detected in the muscle of SBMA patients. Feeding knock-in mice a high-fat diet (HFD) restored mTOR activation, decreased the expression of PGC1α, TFEB, and genes involved in oxidative metabolism, reduced mitochondrial abnormalities, ameliorated muscle pathology, and extended survival. These findings show early-onset and intrinsic metabolic alterations in SBMA muscle and link lipid/glucose metabolism to pathogenesis. Moreover, our results highlight an HFD regime as a promising approach to support SBMA patients.. 2016\n",
            "Stochastic Coherence Over Attention Trajectory For Continuous Learning In Video Streams. Devising intelligent agents able to live in an environment and learn by observing the surroundings is a longstanding goal of Artificial Intelligence. From a bare Machine Learning perspective, challenges arise when the agent is prevented from leveraging large fully-annotated dataset, but rather the interactions with supervisory signals are sparsely distributed over space and time. This paper proposes a novel neural-network-based approach to progressively and autonomously develop pixel-wise representations in a video stream. The proposed method is based on a human-like attention mechanism that allows the agent to learn by observing what is moving in the attended locations. Spatio-temporal stochastic coherence along the attention trajectory, paired with a contrastive term, leads to an unsupervised learning criterion that naturally copes with the considered setting. Differently from most existing works, the learned representations are used in open-set class-incremental classification of each frame pixel, relying on few supervisions. Our experiments leverage 3D virtual environments and they show that the proposed agents can learn to distinguish objects just by observing the video stream.

            "A unifying framework in vector-valued reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces for manifold regularization and co-regularized multi-view learning. This paper presents a general vector-valued reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS) framework for the problem of learning an unknown functional dependency between a structured input space and a structured output space. Our formulation encompasses both Vector-valued Manifold Regularization and Co-regularized Multi-view Learning, providing in particular a unifying framework linking these two important learning approaches. In the case of the least square loss function, we provide a closed form solution, which is obtained by solving a system of linear equations. In the case of Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification, our formulation generalizes in particular both the binary Laplacian SVM to the multi-class, multi-view settings and the multi-class Simplex Cone SVM to the semi-supervised, multi-view settings. The solution is obtained by solving a single quadratic optimization problem, as in standard SVM, via the Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO) approach. Empirical results obtained on the task of object recognition, using several challenging data sets, demonstrate the competitiveness of our algorithms compared with other state-of-the-art methods.. 2016\n",
            "ASI-Biomission VITA Inc. 51/52 NANOROS experiment: Skeletal muscle cell protection against oxidative stress with cerium oxide nanoparticles in space IAC-18-A2.7.9. With low gravity conditions and high energy radiations, space environment exerts deleterious effects on the astronauts' musculoskeletal system, inducing/accelerating loss of skeletal muscle mass and force that are typical of aging or certain pathological conditions on Earth. In astronauts, these effects are partially reversible upon return on Earth, yet they hinder long-term permanence in space and interplanetary exploration. Oxidative stress is among the causes of the observed effects, and its onset both on Earth and in space is related to the unbalanced production/removal of highly reactive species (such as hydroxyl radical, superoxide and singlet oxygen, collectively termed as reactive oxygen species- ROS). These species are typically scavenged by endogenous antioxidant defenses (provided for instance by superoxide dismutase and catalase), in synergy with dietary intakes of natural antioxidants (like vitamins and polyphenols). Traditional antioxidants require constant supply due to their short biological activity, whereas novel materials such as cerium oxide nanoparticles (nanoceria, NC) exhibit a self-regenerative antioxidant property mimicking superoxide dismutase/catalase activity that was demonstrated in a number of cellular models and even in some disease animal models. Selected by the Agenzia Spaziale Italiana for implementation on board the International Space Station (ISS) with increment 51/52, our experiment entitled â€œNanotechnology Solutions against Oxidative Stress in Muscle Tissue during Long-Term Microgravity Exposureâ€&#x9d; (NANOROS) aimed at assessing the protective role of NC as antioxidant agents on differentiating H9c2 myoblasts in space. Preliminary on-ground simulations of the whole experimental timeline (performed in hardware qualified to flight) enabled the identification of suitable cell density (30,000 cells/cm2), NC size (30 nm on average) and coating (with fetal bovine serum) to obtain high RNA concentrations (~100 ng/ul) for transcriptional analyses. The minimum concentration of NC (100 Âµg/ml) suitable to oxidative stress alleviation was also identified by administering increasing concentrations of NC (0-200 Âµg/ml) to differentiating cells, and then by providing oxidative insult with 1 mM H2O2. The amount of ROS generated by this insult was assessed with 2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (H2DCF-DA), which undergoes fluorescence emission after interaction with intracellular ROS, and it was effectively decreased by nanoparticle administration by 200%. Preliminary analyses performed by qRT-PCR demonstrated compensatory effects on transcriptional levels of Cat, Sod1 and Sod2 genes upon NC administration. Cell cultures fixed aboard the ISS were found to be fully adherent and differentiated after return on Earth.. 2018\n",

            "Analytical methods for characterizing the nanoparticle-protein corona. When nanoparticles (NPs) enter a biological environment, medium components, especially proteins, compete for binding to the NP's surface, leading to development of a new interface, commonly referred to as the \"protein corona.\" This rich protein shell gives the NPs a biological identity that can be very different from their synthetic one, in terms of their chemical-physical properties. Understanding NP-protein interaction is crucial for both the bioapplications and safety of nanomaterials. The protein corona provides the primary contact to the cells and their receptors. It defines in vivo fate of the delivery systems, governing the stability, immunogenicity, circulation, clearance rates and organ biodistribution of the NPs. Given its importance, the application and the development of analytical methods to investigate the protein corona are crucial. This review gives an overview of chromatographic, electrophoretic, mass spectrometric and proteomic methods because these techniques have the advantage to be able to identify and quantify individual proteins adsorbed onto the corona.

            "Friendly Training: Neural Networks Can Adapt Data to Make Learning Easier. In the last decade, motivated by the success of Deep Learning, the scientific community proposed several approaches to make the learning procedure of Neural Networks more effective. When focussing on the way in which the training data are provided to the learning machine, we can distinguish between the classic random selection of stochastic gradient-based optimization and more involved techniques that devise curricula to organize data, and progressively increase the complexity of the training set. In this paper, we propose a novel training procedure named Friendly Training that, differently from the aforementioned approaches, involves altering the training examples in order to help the model to better fulfil its learning criterion. The model is allowed to 'simplify' those examples that are too hard to be classified at a certain stage of the training procedure. The data transformation is controlled by a developmental plan that progressively reduces its impact during training, until it completely vanishes. In a sense, this is the opposite of what is commonly done in order to increase robustness against adversarial examples, i.e., Adversarial Training. Experiments on multiple datasets are provided, showing that Friendly Training yields improvements with respect to informed data sub-selection routines and random selection, especially in deep convolutional architectures. Results suggest that adapting the input data is a feasible way to stabilize learning and improve the generalization skills of the network.. 2021\n",

            "midfrontal-occipital ɵ-tacs modulates cognitive conflicts related to bodily stimuli. Neurophysiological studies show that during tasks tapping cognitive control (like the flanker task), midfrontal theta (MFθ) oscillations are associated with conflict and error processing and neural top-down modulation of perceptual processing. What remains unknown is whether perceptual encoding of category-specific stimuli (e.g. body vs letters) used in flanker-like tasks is modulated by theta oscillations. To explore this issue, we delivered transcranial Alternating Current Stimulation (tACS) in the theta frequency band (6 Hz) over the medial frontal cortex (MFC) and the extra-striate body area (EBA), whereas healthy participants performed two variants of the classical flanker task, one with stimuli representing human hands (i.e. hand-flanker) and the other with stimuli representing coloured letters (i.e. letter-flanker). More specifically, we aimed at investigating whether θ-tACS involving a body-related area may modulate the long-range communication between neuronal populations underlying conflict monitoring and visuo-perceptual encoding of hand stimuli without affecting the conflict driven by letter stimuli. Results showed faster correct response times during θ-tACS in the hand-flanker compared with γ-tACS (40 Hz) and sham. Importantly, such an effect did not emerge in the letter-flanker. Our findings show that theta oscillations over midfrontal-occipital areas modulate bodily specific, stimulus content-driven aspects of cognitive control.. 2020\n",

Moreover, in certain nonlinear techniques, the use of a coherent source for exciting the sample leads to the emission of coherent signal, which provides enhancement of signal to multiple orders of magnitude over linear techniques. Combining signals obtained from multiple techniques enriches information, thus helping in creating a superior microscopic image.

In the last two decades, nano manipulation has been recognized as a potential tool of scientific interest especially in nanotechnology and nano-robotics. Contemporary optical microscopy (super resolution) techniques have also reached the nanometer scale resolution to visualize this and hence a combination of super resolution aided nano manipulation ineluctably gives a new perspective to the scenario. Here we demonstrate how specificity and rapid determination of structures provided by stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscope can aid another microscopic tool with capability of mechanical manoeuvring, like an atomic force microscope (AFM) to get topological information or to target nano scaled materials. We also give proof of principle on how high-resolution real time visualization can improve nano manipulation capability within a dense sample, and how STED-AFM is an optimal combination for this job.

            "Enhancing Single-Layer WSe2 Light Emission in Perylene-Doped Polymer Films through Efficient Energy Transfer. The optical and mechanical properties of 2D semiconductors make them excellent candidates for the active components of plastic optoelectronic devices. Here, the integration of single-layer WSe2 (1L-WSe2) into a polystyrene (PS) film containing dispersed perylene orange (PDI-O) molecules is investigated. The findings reveal a notable enhancement in the light emission of 1L-WSe2, which occurs exclusively upon PDI-O excitation and scales with the concentration of molecules in the PS film. Moreover, the increase in 1L-WSe2 photoluminescence coincides with a quenching of the PDI-O light emission intensity and a decrease in its lifetime. These results point to efficient long-range interactions, such as Förster energy transfer, between PDI-O (acting as the donor) and 1L-WSe2 (acting as the acceptor), as the mechanism responsible for the enhanced light emission in the latter. These findings are of great interest for the development of flexible optoelectronic devices integrating active 2D materials; the polymeric matrix plays a dual role, serving as both physical support and host for organic dopants that can optimize the light emission properties of the active 2D material.. 2024\n",
            "Development of reaching to the body in early infancy: From experiments to robotic models. We have been observing how infants between 3 and 21 months react when a vibrotactile stimulation (a buzzer) is applied to different parts of their bodies. Responses included in particular movement of the stimulated body part and successful reaching for and removal of the buzzer. Overall, there is a pronounced developmental progression from general to specific movement patterns, especially in the first year. In this article we review the series of studies we conducted and then focus on possible mechanisms that might explain what we observed. One possible mechanism might rely on the brain extracting 'sensorimotor contingencies' linking motor actions and resulting sensory consequences. This account posits that infants are driven by intrinsic motivation that guides exploratory motor activity, at first generating random motor babbling with self-touch occurring spontaneously. Later goal-oriented motor behavior occurs, with self-touch as a possible effective tool to induce informative contingencies. We connect this sensorimotor view with a second possible account that appeals to the neuroscientific concepts of cortical maps and coordinate transformations. In this second account, the improvement of reaching precision is mediated by refinement of neuronal maps in primary sensory and motor cortices - the homunculi - as well as in frontal and parietal cortical regions dedicated to sensorimotor processing. We complement this theoretical account with modeling on a humanoid robot with artificial skin where we implemented reaching for tactile stimuli as well as learning the 'somatosensory homunculi'. We suggest that this account can be extended to reflect the driving role of sensorimotor contingencies in human development. In our conclusion we consider possible extensions of our current experiments which take account of predictions derived from both these kinds of models.. 2017\n",
            "Ligand signature in the membrane dynamics of single TrkA receptor molecules. The neurotrophin receptor TrkA (also known as NTRK1) is known to be crucially involved in several physio-pathological processes. However, a clear description of the early steps of ligand-induced TrkA responses at the cell plasma membrane is missing. We have exploited single particle tracking and TIRF microscopy to study TrkA membrane lateral mobility and changes of oligomerization state upon binding of diverse TrkA agonists (NGF, NGF R100E HSANV mutant, proNGF and NT-3). We show that, in the absence of ligands, most of the TrkA receptors are fast moving monomers characterized by an average diffusion coefficient of 0.47 m2/second; about 20% of TrkA molecules move at least an order of magnitude slower and around 4% are almost immobile within regions of about 0.6 mm diameter. Ligand binding results in increased slow and/or immobile populations over the fast one, slowing down of non-immobile trajectories and reduction of confinement areas, observations that are consistent with the formation of receptor dimeric and oligomeric states. We demonstrate that the extent of TrkA lateral mobility modification is strictly ligand dependent and that each ligand promotes distinct trajectory patterns of TrkA receptors at the cell membrane (ligand 'fingerprinting' effect). This ligand signature of receptor dynamics results from a differential combination of receptor-binding affinity, intracellular effectors recruited in the signalling platforms and formation of signalling and/or recycling endosome precursors. Thus, our data uncover a close correlation between the initial receptor membrane dynamics triggered upon binding and the specific biological outcomes induced by different ligands for the same receptor. © 2013.

Anodization of Ni3Al alloy is of interest in the field of industrial manufacturing, thanks to the formation of protective oxide layer on the materials working in corrosive environments and high temperatures. However, homogeneous surface treatment is paramount for technological applications of this material. The anodization conditions have to be set outside the ranges of corrosion and “burning,” which is the electric-field-enhanced anodic dissolution of the metal. In order to check against occurrence of these events, proper quantitative means for assessing the surface quality have to be developed and established. We approached this task by advanced analysis of scanning electron microscope images of anodized Ni3Al plates. The anodization was carried out in 0.3M citric acid at two temperatures of 0 and 30°C and at voltages in the range of 2–12 V. Different figures can be used to characterize the quality of the surface, in terms of uniformity.

In the last few years, the scientific community showed a remarkable and increasing interest towards 3D Virtual Environments, training and testing Machine Learning-based models in realistic virtual worlds. On one hand, these environments could also become a mean to study the weaknesses of Machine Learning algorithms, or to simulate training settings that allow Machine Learning models to gain robustness to 3D adversarial attacks. On the other hand, their growing popularity might also attract those that aim at creating adversarial conditions to invalidate the benchmarking process, especially in the case of public environments that allow the contribution from a large community of people. Most of the existing Adversarial Machine Learning approaches are focused on static images, and little work has been done in studying how to deal with 3D environments and how a 3D object should be altered to fool a classifier that observes it. In this paper, we study how to craft adversarial 3D objects by altering their textures, using a tool chain composed of easily accessible elements. We show that it is possible, and indeed simple, to create adversarial objects using off-the-shelf limited surrogate renderers that can compute gradients with respect to the parameters of the rendering process, and, to a certain extent, to transfer the attacks to more advanced 3D engines. We propose a saliency-based attack that intersects the two classes of renderers in order to focus the alteration to those texture elements that are estimated to be effective in the target engine, evaluating its impact in popular neural classifiers.. 2021\n",

The tumor microenvironment restrains conventional T cell (Tconv) activation while facilitating the expansion of Tregs. Here we showed that Tregs’ advantage in the tumor milieu relies on supplemental energetic routes involving lipid metabolism. In murine models, tumor-infiltrating Tregs displayed intracellular lipid accumulation, which was attributable to an increased rate of fatty acid (FA) synthesis. Since the relative advantage in glucose uptake may fuel FA synthesis in intratumoral Tregs, we demonstrated that both glycolytic and oxidative metabolism contribute to Tregs’ expansion. We corroborated our data in human tumors showing that Tregs displayed a gene signature oriented toward glycolysis and lipid synthesis. Our data support a model in which signals from the tumor microenvironment induce a circuitry of glycolysis, FA synthesis, and oxidation that confers a preferential proliferative advantage to Tregs, whose targeting might represent a strategy for cancer treatment.. 2018\n",

The availability of grasp quality measures is fundamental for grasp planning and control, and also to drive designers in the definition and optimization of robotic hands. This work investigates on grasp robustness and quality indexes that can be applied to power grasps with underactuated and compliant hands. When dealing with such types of hands, there is the need of an evaluation method that takes into account the forces that can be actually controlled by the hand, depending on its actuation system. In this paper, we study the potential contact robustness and the potential grasp robustness (PCR, PGR) indexes. They both consider main grasp properties: contact points, friction coefficient, etc., but also hand degrees of freedom and consequently, the directions of controllable contact forces. The PCR comes directly from the classical grasp theory and can be easily evaluated, but often leads to too conservative solutions, particularly when the grasp has many contacts. The PGR is more complex and computationally heavier, but gives a more realistic, even if still conservative, estimation of the overall grasp robustness, also in power grasps. We evaluated the indexes for various simulated grasps, performed with underactuated and compliant hands, and we analyzed their variations with respect to the main grasp parameters.. 2017\n",
            "Design optimization of supports for overhanging structures in aluminum and titanium alloys by selective laser melting. Selective laser melting (SLM) process allows fabricating strong, lightweight and complex metallic structures. To successfully produce metallic parts by SLM, additional structures are needed to support overhanging surfaces in order to dissipate process heat and to minimize geometrical distortions induced by internal stresses. However, these structures are often massive and require additional post-processing for their removal. A minimization of support structures would therefore significantly reduce manufacturing and finishing efforts and costs. This study investigates the manufacturability of overhanging structures using optimized support parts. An experimental study was performed to identify the optimal self-supporting overhanging structures using Taguchi L36 design. Experimental results revealed that with optimized supports it is possible to build non-assembly mechanism with overhang surfaces. However, it is necessary to correctly orientate the part in the SLM machine in order to build it with a minimal support structure so to obtain the best trade-off between production time, cost, and accuracy.. 2014\n",
            "A lagrangian approach to information propagation in graph neural networks. In many real world applications, data are characterized by a complex structure, that can be naturally encoded as a graph. In the last years, the popularity of deep learning techniques has renewed the interest in neural models able to process complex patterns. In particular, inspired by the Graph Neural Network (GNN) model, different architectures have been proposed to extend the original GNN scheme. GNNs exploit a set of state variables, each assigned to a graph node, and a diffusion mechanism of the states among neighbor nodes, to implement an iterative procedure to compute the fixed point of the (learnable) state transition function. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to the state computation and the learning algorithm for GNNs, based on a constraint optimisation task solved in the Lagrangian framework. The state convergence procedure is implicitly expressed by the constraint satisfaction mechanism and does not require a separate iterative phase for each epoch of the learning procedure. In fact, the computational structure is based on the search for saddle points of the Lagrangian in the adjoint space composed of weights, neural outputs (node states), and Lagrange multipliers. The proposed approach is compared experimentally with other popular models for processing graphs.. 2020\n",
            "Nano-topography: Quicksand for cell cycle progression?. The 3-D spatial and mechanical features of nano-topography can create alternative environments, which influence cellular response. In this paper, murine fibroblast cells were grown on surfaces characterized by protruding nanotubes. Cells cultured on such nano-structured surface exhibit stronger cellular adhesion compared to control groups, but despite the fact that stronger adhesion is generally believed to promote cell cycle progression, the time cells spend in G1 phase is doubled. This apparent contradiction is solved by confocal microscopy analysis, which shows that the nano-topography inhibits actin stress fiber formation. In turn, this impairs RhoA activation, which is required to suppress the inhibition of cell cycle progression imposed by p21/p27. This finding suggests that the generation of stress fibers, required to impose the homeostatic intracellular tension, rather than cell adhesion/spreading is the limiting factor for cell cycle progression. Indeed, nano-topography could represent a unique tool to inhibit proliferation in adherent well-spread cells.. 2018\n",

Miniaturized solid state capacitors leveraging migration of unipolar ions in a single polyelectrolyte layer sandwiched between metal electrodes, namely, polyelectrolyte capacitors (PECs), have been recently reported with areal capacitance up to 100–200 nF mm−2. Nonetheless, application of PECs in consumer and industrial electronics has been hindered so far by their small operational frequency range, up to a few kHz, due to the resistive behavior (phase angle >−45°) of PECs in the range kHz-to-MHz. Here, it is reported on multilayer polyelectrolyte capacitors (mPECs) that leverage as dielectric an ambipolar nanometer-thick (down to 10 nm) stack of anionic and cationic polyelectrolytes assembled layer-by-layer between metal electrodes to eliminate the resistive behavior at frequencies from kHz to MHz. This significantly extends the operational range of mPECs over PECs. mPECs with areal capacitance as high as 25 nF mm−2 at 20 Hz and full capacitive behavior from 100 mHz to 10 MHz are demonstrated using different assembling conditions and anionic/cationic polyelectrolyte pairs. The mPECs reliably operate over time for >300 million cycles, at different biasing voltages up to 3 V, and temperatures up to 80 °C, showing a reversible capacitive behavior without significant hysteresis.

Recently, researchers in Machine Learning algorithms, Computer Vision scientists, engineers and others, showed a growing interest in 3D simulators as a mean to artificially create experimental settings that are very close to those in the real world. However, most of the existing platforms to interface algorithms with 3D environments are often designed to setup navigation-related experiments, to study physical interactions, or to handle ad-hoc cases that are not thought to be customized, sometimes lacking a strong photorealistic appearance and an easy-to-use software interface. In this paper, we present a novel platform, SAILenv, that is specifically designed to be simple and customizable, and that allows researchers to experiment visual recognition in virtual 3D scenes. A few lines of code are needed to interface every algorithm with the virtual world, and non-3D-graphics experts can easily customize the 3D environment itself, exploiting a collection of photorealistic objects. Our framework yields pixel-level semantic and instance labeling, depth, and, to the best of our knowledge, it is the only one that provides motion-related information directly inherited from the 3D engine. The client-server communication operates at a low level, avoiding the overhead of HTTP-based data exchanges. We perform experiments using a state-of-the-art object detector trained on real-world images, showing that it is able to recognize the photorealistic 3D objects of our environment. The computational burden of the optical flow compares favourably with the estimation performed using modern GPU-based convolutional networks or more classic implementations. We believe that the scientific community will benefit from the easiness and high-quality of our framework to evaluate newly proposed algorithms in their own customized realistic conditions.. 2020\n",

The prolonged heat-treated IN625 samples are investigated by Optical Microscope (OM), Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FESEM) and X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) analysis, whereas the mechanical properties are evaluated by hardness test.. 2017\n",

            "Characterisation of Photocathodes Based on Pb Thin Film Deposited by UV Pulsed Laser Ablation. This work deals with the deposition of lead (Pb) thin films by the UV pulsed laser ablation technique, for their further use as photocathode devices in superconducting radio frequency guns. Scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy analyses were performed to study the morphological features of Pb thin films deposited on Si (100) and Nb substrates. The films showed a granular structure with a nearly fully covered surface only for that one deposited on Nb substrate. X-ray diffraction measurements indicate the growth of polycrystalline Pb thin films with a preferential orientation along (111) planes. Results of the photoemission performance of Pb thin film deposited on Nb substrate showed a very encouraging average value of quantum efficiency of 6×10-5 through a single-photon absorption process, promoting further studies in the realisation of Pb photocathodes by this technique. © 2013.. 2014\n",
            "Inductive–transductive learning with graph neural networks. Graphs are a natural choice to encode data in many real–world applications. In fact, a graph can describe a given pattern as a complex structure made up of parts (the nodes) and relationships between them (the edges). Despite their rich representational power, most of machine learning approaches cannot deal directly with inputs encoded by graphs. Indeed, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been devised as an extension of recursive models, able to process general graphs, possibly undirected and cyclic. In particular, GNNs can be trained to approximate all the “practically useful” functions on the graph space, based on the classical inductive learning approach, realized within the supervised framework. However, the information encoded in the edges can actually be used in a more refined way, to switch from inductive to transductive learning. In this paper, we present an inductive–transductive learning scheme based on GNNs. The proposed approach is evaluated both on artificial and real–world datasets showing promising results. The recently released GNN software, based on the Tensorflow library, is made available for interested users.. 2018\n",

In this paper we present the results of two experimental evaluations carried out in the broader context of a research project on Industry 4.0. We envision in large displays operated through gestural interaction one of the key technologies for enabling real-time management of production processes and supporting decision-making. We developed prototype applications with the twofold aim of: (1) designing a vocabulary of one-handed, touchless gestures meant for interaction in a CAD-like environment, and (2) investigating the role of the cursor feedback.

            "Stabilizing Layered BiOBr Photoelectrocatalyst by Van Der Waals Heterojunction Strategy. The photoelectrocatalytic (PEC) hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) holds immense promise as a clean and sustainable method for hydrogen production. However, finding a suitable catalyst which is efficient, stable and scalable still remains an open challenge. BiOBr is a 2D layered material studied as photoelectrocatalyst because of its suitable band gap for light absorption and potential for up-scalable production. However, its application in HER is not commonly reported, because of instability in a cathodic PEC environment, driven by a strong tendency to reduction to metallic bismuth. To solve this problem, 2D MoS2 is used to induce the formation of a van der Waals (vdW) layered heterojunction (HJ) to stabilize the lattice of BiOBr during HER. By performing PEC HER with the HJs containing different ratios of MoS2, it is found that the HJ with 1 % MoS2 can increase the stability of BiOBr, while the one with 50 % MoS2 can even accelerate the reduction of BiOBr to metallic bismuth. DFT calculations reveal that the interface between BiOBr and MoS2 in the HJ with 1 % MoS2 tends to push active electrons on the sulfur atoms, thus favoring HER. On the other hand, in the 50 % HJ, active electrons are prone to react with BiOBr to induce reduction. In situ wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD) on the MoS2/BiOBr HJs with 1 % and 50 % of MoS2 allows to track the phase change and the phase transfer speed of BiOBr during PEC HER. Interestingly, when the HJ is illuminated with UV light, a lower amount of BiOBr is reduced to Bi under negative potential, due to the presence of photogenerated holes reacting with the extra electrons derived from the negative bias and preventing the BiOBr photon absorber to be further reduced.. 2024\n",

Motivation: Atomistic or coarse grained (CG) potentials derived from statistical distributions of internal variables have recently become popular due to the need of simplified interactions for reaching larger scales in simulations or more efficient conformational space sampling. However, the process of parameterization of accurate and predictive statistics-based force fields requires a huge amount of work and is prone to the introduction of bias and errors.Results: This article introduces SecStAnT, a software for the creation and analysis of protein structural datasets with user-defined primary/secondary structure composition, with a particular focus on the CG representation.

Semiconductor nanocrystals, especially their ordered assemblies, are promising materials for various applications. In this paper, we investigate the photoconductive behavior of sub-micron size, ordered three-dimensional (3D) assemblies of octapod-shaped CdSe/CdS nanocrystals that are contacted by overlay electron-beam lithography. The regular structure of the assemblies leads to photocurrent-voltage curves that can be described by the cold field electron emission model. Mapping of the photoconductivity versus excitation wavelength and bias voltage allows the extraction of the band gap and identification of the photoactive region in the voltage and spectral domain.

            "Vapor-Phase Synthesis of Molecularly Imprinted Polymers on Nanostructured Materials at Room-Temperature. Molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) have recently emerged as robust and versatile artificial receptors. MIP synthesis is carried out in liquid phase and optimized on planar surfaces. Application of MIPs to nanostructured materials is challenging due to diffusion-limited transport of monomers within the nanomaterial recesses, especially when the aspect ratio is >10. Here, the room temperature vapor-phase synthesis of MIPs in nanostructured materials is reported. The vapor phase synthesis leverages a >1000-fold increase in the diffusion coefficient of monomers in vapor phase, compared to liquid phase, to relax diffusion-limited transport and enable the controlled synthesis of MIPs also in nanostructures with high aspect ratio. As proof-of-concept application, pyrrole is used as the functional monomer thanks to its large exploitation in MIP preparation; nanostructured porous silicon oxide (PSiO2) is chosen to assess the vapor-phase deposition of PPy-based MIP in nanostructures with aspect ratio >100; human hemoglobin (HHb) is selected as the target molecule for the preparation of a MIP-based PSiO2 optical sensor. High sensitivity and selectivity, low detection limit, high stability and reusability are achieved in label-free optical detection of HHb, also in human plasma and artificial serum. The proposed vapor-phase synthesis of MIPs is immediately transferable to other nanomaterials, transducers, and proteins.. 2023\n",

A previously developed polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) microdevice able to purify and detect circulating miRNAs was here optimized. The optimization of the morphological and chemical surface properties by nanopatterning and functionalization is presented. Surfaces were firstly characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), fluorescamine assay and s-SDTB (sulphosuccinimidyl-4-o-(4,4-dimethoxytrityl) butyrate) assay and subsequently tested for their capacity to adsorb a fluorescent miRNA.

            "Do not resonate with actions: Sentence polarity modulates cortico-spinal excitability during action-related sentence reading. Background: Theories of embodied language suggest that the motor system is differentially called into action when processing motor-related versus abstract content words or sentences. It has been recently shown that processing negative polarity action-related sentences modulates neural activity of premotor and motor cortices. Methods and Findings: We sought to determine whether reading negative polarity sentences brought about differential modulation of cortico-spinal motor excitability depending on processing hand-action related or abstract sentences. Facilitatory paired-pulses Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (pp-TMS) was applied to the primary motor representation of the right-hand and the recorded amplitude of induced motor-evoked potentials (MEP) was used to index M1 activity during passive reading of either hand-action related or abstract content sentences presented in both negative and affirmative polarity. Results showed that the cortico-spinal excitability was affected by sentence polarity only in the hand-action related condition. Indeed, in keeping with previous TMS studies, reading positive polarity, hand action-related sentences suppressed cortico-spinal reactivity. This effect was absent when reading hand action-related negative polarity sentences. Moreover, no modulation of cortico-spinal reactivity was associated with either negative or positive polarity abstract sentences. Conclusions: Our results indicate that grammatical cues prompting motor negation reduce the cortico-spinal suppression associated with affirmative action sentences reading and thus suggest that motor simulative processes underlying the embodiment may involve even syntactic features of language. © 2011 Liuzza et al.. 2011\n",
            "Reorganization of the outer layer of a model of the plasma membrane induced by a neuroprotective aminosterol. Trodusquemine is an amphipathic aminosterol that has recently shown therapeutic benefit in neurodegenerative diseases altering the binding of misfolded proteins to the cell membrane. To unravel the underlying mechanism, we studied the interactions between Trodusquemine (TRO) and lipid monolayers simulating the outer layer of the plasma membrane. We selected two different compositions of dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC), sphingomyelin (SM), cholesterol (Chol) and monosialotetrahexosylganglioside (GM1) lipid mixture mimicking either a lipid-raft containing membrane (Ld+So phases) or a single-phase disordered membrane (Ld phase). Surface pressure-area isotherms and surface compressional modulus-area combined with Brewster Angle Microscopy (BAM) provided the thermodynamic and morphological information on the lipid monolayer in the presence of increasing amounts of TRO in the monolayer. Experiments revealed that TRO forms stable spreading monolayers at the buffer-air interface where it undergoes multiple reversible phase transitions to bi- and tri-layers at the interface. When TRO was spread at the interface with the lipid mixtures, we found that it distributes in the lipid monolayer for both the selected lipid compositions, but a maximum TRO uptake in the rafts-containing monolayer was observed for a Lipid/TRO molar ratio equal to 3:2. Statistical analysis of BAM images revealed that TRO induces a decrease in the size of the condensed domains, an increase in their number and in the thickness mismatch between the Ld and So phase. Experiments and MD simulations converge to indicate that TRO adsorbs preferentially at the border of the So domains. Removal of GM1 from the lipid Ld+So mixture resulted in an even greater TRO-mediated reduction of the size of the So domains suggesting that the presence of GM1 hinders the localization of TRO at the So domains boundaries. Taken together these observations suggest that Trodusquemine influences the organization of lipid rafts within the neuronal membrane in a dose-dependent manner whereas it evenly distributes in disordered expanded phases of the membrane model.. 2023\n",
            "Egr-1 maintains NSC proliferation and its overexpression counteracts cell cycle exit triggered by the withdrawal of epidermal growth factor. In adult mammals, neural stem cells (NSCs) reside in specialized niches at the level of selected CNS regions, such as the subventricular zone (SVZ). The signaling pathways that reg-ulate NSC proliferation and differentiation remain poorly understood. Early growth response protein 1 (Egr-1) is an important transcription factor, widely studied in the adult mammalian brain, mediating the activation of target genes by a variety of extracellular stimuli. In our study, we aimed at testing how Egr-1 regulates adult NSCs derived from mouse SVZ and, in particular, the interplay between Egr-1 and the proliferative factor EGF. We demonstrate that Egr-1 expression in NSCs is induced by growth factor stimulation, and its level decreases after EGF deprivation or by using AG1478, an inhibitor of the EGF/EGFR signaling pathway. We also show that Egr-1 overexpression rescues the cell proliferation decrease observed either after EGF removal or upon treatment with AG1478, suggesting that Egr-1 works downstream of the EGF pathway. To better understand this mechanism, we investigated targets downstream of both the EGF pathway and Egr-1, and found that they regulate genes involved in NSC proliferation, such as cell cycle regulators, cyclins, and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors.. 2018\n",
            "Task-dependent spatial processing in the visual cortex. To solve spatial tasks, the human brain asks for support from the visual cortices. Nonetheless, representing spatial information is not fixed but depends on the reference frames in which the spatial inputs are involved. The present study investigates how the kind of spatial representations influences the recruitment of visual areas during multisensory spatial tasks. Our study tested participants in an electroencephalography experiment involving two audio–visual (AV) spatial tasks: a spatial bisection, in which participants estimated the relative position in space of an AV stimulus in relation to the position of two other stimuli, and a spatial localization, in which participants localized one AV stimulus in relation to themselves. Results revealed that spatial tasks specifically modulated the occipital event-related potentials (ERPs) after the onset of the stimuli. We observed a greater contralateral early occipital component (50–90 ms) when participants solved the spatial bisection, and a more robust later occipital response (110–160 ms) when they processed the spatial localization. This observation suggests that different spatial representations elicited by multisensory stimuli are sustained by separate neurophysiological mechanisms.. 2023\n",
            "Super-resolution microscopy reveals the nanoscale cluster architecture of the DEK protein cancer biomarker. DEK protein, a key chromatin regulator, is strongly overexpressed in various forms of cancer. While conventional microscopy revealed DEK as uniformly distributed within the cell nucleus, advanced super-resolution techniques uncovered cluster-like structures. However, a comprehensive understanding of DEK's cellular distribution and its implications in cancer and cell growth remained elusive. To bridge this gap, we employed single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) to dissect DEK's nanoscale organization in both normal-like and aggressive breast cancer cell lines. Our investigation included characteristics such as localizations per cluster, cluster areas, and intra-cluster localization densities (ICLDs). We elucidated how cluster features align with different breast cell types and how chromatin decompaction influences DEK clusters in these contexts. Our results indicate that DEK's intra-cluster localization density and nano-organization remain preserved and not significantly influenced by protein overexpression or chromatin compaction changes. This study advances the understanding of DEK's role in cancer and underscores its stable nanoscale behavior.. 2023\n",
            "Neutrophil extracellular traps profiles in patients with incident systemic lupus erythematosus and lupus nephritis. Objective. Neutrophil extracellular traps (NET) expose modified antigens for autoantibodies in vasculitis. Little is known about levels and removal pathways of NET in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), especially in lupus nephritis (LN). We determined circulating levels and defined NET removal in large subsets of patients with incident SLE (iSLE), some of whom had new-onset nephritis. Methods. Serum levels of NET (ELISA), DNase1/DNase1L3 (ELISA), and DNase activity (functional assay) were determined in 216 patients with iSLE [103 had incident LN (iLN)], in 50 patients with other primary glomerulonephritis, and in healthy controls. Ex vivo NET production by neutrophils purified from a random selection of patients was quantified as elastase/DNA release and by immunofluorescence techniques. Results. Serum NET levels were very high in iSLE/iLN compared to all groups of controls and correlated with anti-dsDNA, C3-C4, and proteinuria; iLN had the highest levels. DNase activity was decreased in iLN compared to SLE (20% had one-half DNase activity) despite similar serum levels of DNase1/DNase1L3. In these cases, pretreatment of serum with protein A restored DNase efficiency; 1 patient was homozygous for a c.289_290delAC variant of DNASE1L3. Ex vivo NET production by neutrophils purified from LN, SLE, and normal controls was similar in all cases. Conclusion. Patients with iLN have increased circulating NET and reduced DNase activity, the latter being explained by the presence of inhibitory substances in circulation and/or by rare DNase1L3 mutations. Accumulation of NET derives from a multifactorial mechanism, and is associated and may contribute to disease severity in SLE, in particular to renal lesions.

            "Elucidating the Effect of Static Electric Field on Amyloid Beta 1–42 Supramolecular Assembly. Amyloid-β (Aβ) aggregation is recognized to be a key toxic factor in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease, which is the most common progressive neurodegenerative disorder. In vitro experiments have elucidated that Aβ aggregation depends on several factors, such as pH, temperature and peptide concentration. Despite the research effort in this field, the fundamental mechanism responsible for the disease progression is still unclear. Recent research has proposed the application of electric fields as a non-invasive therapeutic option leading to the disruption of amyloid fibrils. In this regard, a molecular level understanding of the interactions governing the destabilization mechanism represents an important research advancement. Understanding the electric field effects on proteins, provides a more in-depth comprehension of the relationship between protein conformation and electrostatic dipole moment. The present study focuses on investigating the effect of static Electric Field (EF) on the conformational dynamics of Aβ fibrils by all-atom Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations.

            "Ultrasonic waves effect on S-shaped β-amyloids conformational dynamics by non-equilibrium molecular dynamics. Ultrasound-based technologies are widely adopted in the clinical practice. Recently, the ultrasound stable cavitation has been proposed as a strategy to destabilize amyloid aggregates in Alzheimer disease. However, the molecular mechanisms driving ultrasound-induced amyloid destabilization are not fully clarified yet. Here, molecular dynamics is applied to investigate in silico the conformational dynamics induced by ultrasound stable cavitation on S-shaped Aβ1-42 amyloid fibrils, which has been highlighted as a more stable architecture with respect to U-shaped Aβ1-42. The findings of the study suggested that ultrasound exposure could affect S-shaped aggregates folding dynamics and kinetics, with a marked dependence on the fibril polymorphism. More in detail, here we suggest that the molecular mechanisms of amyloid destabilization could be driven by residues not involved in defined secondary structures, with unstructured amyloid regions acting as source of instability for the overall fibril by opening a nanofracture able to propagate into the protein, until the complete unfolding of the molecular assembly takes place.. 2020\n",

In this work we present some results about the low temperature, plasma-assisted growth of silicon-oxygen amorphous thin film alloys (a-SiOx) on different types of dental materials used for the fabrication of dental prostheses. The a-SiOx films were grown at substrate temperatures lower than 70 °C by a PECVD deposition system using silane (SiH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) as precursor gases. The chemical bonding structure of the films was investigated by Fourier transform infra-red spectroscopy (FTIR), while the morphological characteristics of the dental materials were analyzed before and after the coating deposition by means of high-resolution mechanical profilometry. The surface energy of dental materials was estimated before and after the coating process by contact angle measurements, revealing that the coating produced a considerable change of surface energy in all the tested samples, evidenced by a contact angle reduction from more than 90° to less than 10°. Some tests were also performed to estimate the effect of the coating on the bacterial adhesion properties, revealing that the a-SiOx coatings show some effectiveness in reducing the bacterial adhesion on the dental materials surface. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

            "Notch3-regulated microRNAs impair CXCR4-dependent maturation of thymocytes allowing maintenance and progression of T-ALL. Malignant transformation of T-cell progenitors causes T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), an aggressive childhood lymphoproliferative disorder. Activating mutations of Notch, Notch1 and Notch3, have been detected in T-ALL patients. In this study, we aimed to deeply characterize hyperactive Notch3-related pathways involved in T-cell dynamics within the thymus and bone marrow to propose these processes as an important step in facilitating the progression of T-ALL. We previously generated a transgenic T-ALL mouse model (N3-ICtg) demonstrating that aberrant Notch3 signaling affects early thymocyte maturation programs and leads to bone marrow infiltration by CD4+CD8+ (DP) T cells that are notably, Notch3highCXCR4high. Newly, our in vivo results suggest that an anomalous immature thymocyte subpopulation, such as CD4−CD8− (DN) over-expressing CD3ɛ, but with low CXCR4 expression, dominates N3-ICtg thymus-resident DN subset in T-ALL progression. MicroRNAs might be of significance in T-ALL pathobiology, however, whether required for leukemia maintenance is not fully understood. The selection of specific DN subsets demonstrates the inverse correlation between CXCR4 expression and a panel of Notch3-deregulated miRNAs. Interestingly, we found that within DN thymocyte subset hyperactive Notch3 inhibits CXCR4 expression through the cooperative effects of miR-139-5p and miR-150-5p, thus impinging on thymocyte differentiation with accumulation of DNCD3ɛ+CXCR4− cells. These data point out that deregulation of Notch3 in T-ALL, besides its role in sustaining dissemination of abnormal DP T cells, as we previously demonstrated, could play a role in selecting specific DN immature T cells within the thymus, thus impeding T cell development, to facilitate T-ALL progression inside the bone marrow.. 2024\n",
            "Induced Fit in Protein Multimerization: The HFBI Case. Hydrophobins, produced by filamentous fungi, are small amphipathic proteins whose biological functions rely on their unique surface-activity properties. Understanding the mechanistic details of the multimerization process is of primary importance to clarify the interfacial activity of hydrophobins. We used free energy calculations to study the role of a flexible β-hairpin in the multimerization process in hydrophobin II from Trichoderma reesei (HFBI). We characterized how the displacement of this β-hairpin controls the stability of the monomers/dimers/tetramers in solution. The regulation of the oligomerization equilibrium of HFBI will necessarily affect its interfacial properties, fundamental for its biological function and for technological applications. Moreover, we propose possible routes for the multimerization process of HFBI in solution.

            "Cell penetrating peptide modulation of membrane biomechanics by Molecular dynamics. The efficacy of a pharmaceutical treatment is often countered by the inadequate membrane permeability, that prevents drugs from reaching their specific intracellular targets. Cell penetrating peptides (CPPs) are able to route across cells’ membrane various types of cargo, including drugs and nanoparticles. However, CPPs internalization mechanisms are not yet fully understood and depend on a wide variety of aspects. In this contest, the entry of a CPP into the lipid bilayer might induce molecular conformational changes, including marked variations on membrane's mechanical properties. Understanding how the CPP does influence the mechanical properties of cells membrane is crucial to design, engineer and improve new and existing penetrating peptides. Here, all atom Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations were used to investigate the interaction between different types of CPPs embedded in a lipid bilayer of dioleoyl phosphatidylcholine (DOPC). In a greater detail, we systematically highlighted how CPP properties are responsible for modulating the membrane bending modulus. Our findings highlighted the CPP hydropathy strongly correlated with penetration of water molecules in the lipid bilayer, thus supporting the hypothesis that the amount of water each CPP can route inside the membrane is modulated by the hydrophobic and hydrophilic character of the peptide. Water penetration promoted by CPPs leads to a local decrease of the lipid order, which emerges macroscopically as a reduction of the membrane bending modulus.. 2018\n",

Silicon resonant microcantilevers for the measurement of the absolute pressure have been fabricated through micromachining processes. The first release is based on vertical resonant actuation and detection, both externally implemented, respectively through a piezoelectric actuator and an optical lever. The variation in resonance response was investigated as a function of pressure (10-1%105 Pa), both in terms of resonance frequency and quality factor. We demonstrated the feasibility of a miniaturized absolute pressure sensor working over a six decades range. The second release is based on lateral resonating microcantilevers in which a significative upgrade is represented by the miniaturization and integration of the actuator and the sensing directly on chip providing a more compact and potentially interesting solution for industrial vacuum applications.

            "Nanomaterials as Microglia Modulators in the Treatment of Central Nervous System Disorders. Microglia play a pivotal role in the central nervous system (CNS) homeostasis, acting as housekeepers and defenders of the surrounding environment. These cells can elicit their functions by shifting into two main phenotypes: pro-inflammatory classical phenotype, M1, and anti-inflammatory alternative phenotype, M2. Despite their pivotal role in CNS homeostasis, microglia phenotypes can influence the development and progression of several CNS disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, ischemic stroke, traumatic brain injuries, and even brain cancer. It is thus clear that the possibility of modulating microglia activation has gained attention as a therapeutic tool against many CNS pathologies. Nanomaterials are an unprecedented tool for manipulating microglia responses, in particular, to specifically target microglia and elicit an in situ immunomodulation activity. This review focuses the discussion on two main aspects: analyzing the possibility of using nanomaterials to stimulate a pro-inflammatory response of microglia against brain cancer and introducing nanostructures able to foster an anti-inflammatory response for treating neurodegenerative disorders. The final aim is to stimulate the analysis of the development of new microglia nano-immunomodulators, paving the way for innovative and effective therapeutic approaches for the treatment of CNS disorders.. 2024\n",

The ART corpus features three experimental conditions - solo reading, alternating reading, and deliberate imitation - as well as three sub-corpora encompassing French-, Italian-, and Slovak-accented English. This design allows systematic investigation of speech entrainment in a controlled and less-spontaneous setting. Alongside detailed transcriptions, it includes English proficiency scores, demographics, and in-experiment questionnaires for probing linguistic, personal and interpersonal influences on entrainment. Our presentation covers its design, collection, annotation processes, initial analysis, and future research prospects.. 2024\n",
            "Sequentially Deposited versus Conventional Nonfullerene Organic Solar Cells: Interfacial Trap States, Vertical Stratification, and Exciton Dissociation. Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) nonfullerene organic solar cells prepared from sequentially deposited donor and acceptor layers (sq-BHJ) have recently been shown to be highly efficient, environmentally friendly, and compatible with large area and roll-to-roll fabrication. However, the related photophysics at donor-acceptor interface and the vertical heterogeneity of donor-acceptor distribution, critical for exciton dissociation and device performance, have been largely unexplored. Herein, steady-state and time-resolved optical and electrical techniques are employed to characterize the interfacial trap states. Correlating with the luminescent efficiency of interfacial states and its nonradiative recombination, interfacial trap states are characterized to be about 40% more populated in the sq-BHJ devices than the as-cast BHJ (c-BHJ), which probably limits the device voltage output. Cross-sectional energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy depth profiling directly visualize the donor–acceptor vertical stratification with a precision of 1–2 nm. From the proposed “needle” model, the high exciton dissociation efficiency is rationalized. This study highlights the promise of sequential deposition to fabricate efficient solar cells, and points toward improving the voltage output and overall device performance via eliminating interfacial trap states.. 2019\n",
            "Crystallization of levitons in the fractional quantum Hall regime. Using a periodic train of Lorentzian voltage pulses, which generates solitonlike electronic excitations called levitons, we investigate the charge density backscattered off a quantum point contact in the fractional quantum Hall regime. We find a regular pattern of peaks and valleys, reminiscent of analogous self-organization recently observed for optical solitons in nonlinear environments. This crystallization phenomenon is confirmed by additional side dips in the Hong-Ou-Mandel noise, a feature that can be observed in present-day electron quantum optics experiments.. 2018\n",
            "Pressure and stress tensor of complex anharmonic crystals within the stochastic self-consistent harmonic approximation. The self-consistent harmonic approximation (SCHA) allows the computation of free energy of anharmonic crystals considering both quantum and thermal fluctuations. Recently, a stochastic implementation of the SCHA has been developed, tailored for applications that use total energy and forces computed from first principles. In this paper, we extend the applicability of the stochastic SCHA to complex crystals, i.e., systems in which symmetries do not fix the inner coordinates and require the optimization of both the lattice vectors and the atomic positions. To this goal, we provide an expression for the evaluation of the pressure and stress tensor within the stochastic SCHA formalism. Moreover, we develop a more robust free-energy minimization algorithm, which allows us to perform the SCHA variational minimization very efficiently in systems having a broad spectrum of phonon frequencies and many degrees of freedom. We test and illustrate the approach with an application to the phase XI of water ice using density-functional theory. We find that the SCHA reproduces extremely well the experimental thermal expansion of ice in the whole temperature range between 0 and 270K, in contrast with the results obtained within the quasiharmonic approximation, that underestimates the effect by about 25%.. 2018\n",
            "Neuromuscular magnetic stimulation counteracts muscle decline in ALS patients: results of a randomized, double-blind, controlled study. The aim of the study was to verify whether neuromuscular magnetic stimulation (NMMS) improves muscle function in spinal-onset amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients. Twenty-two ALS patients were randomized in two groups to receive, daily for two weeks, NMMS in right or left arm (referred to as real-NMMS, rNMMS), and sham NMMS (sNMMS) in the opposite arm. All the patients underwent a median nerve conduction (compound muscle action potential, CMAP) study and a clinical examination that included a handgrip strength test and an evaluation of upper limb muscle strength by means of the Medical Research Council Muscle Scale (MRC). Muscle biopsy was then performed bilaterally on the flexor carpi radialis muscle to monitor morpho-functional parameters and molecular changes. Patients and physicians who performed examinations were blinded to the side of real intervention. The primary outcome was the change in the muscle strength in upper arms. The secondary outcomes were the change from baseline in the CMAP amplitudes, in the nicotinic ACh currents, in the expression levels of a selected panel of genes involved in muscle growth and atrophy, and in histomorphometric parameters of ALS muscle fibers. The Repeated Measures (RM) ANOVA with a Greenhouse-Geisser correction (sphericity not assumed) showed a significant effect [F(3, 63) = 5.907, p < 0.01] of rNMMS on MRC scale at the flexor carpi radialis muscle, thus demonstrating that the rNMMS significantly improves muscle strength in flexor muscles in the forearm. Secondary outcomes showed that the improvement observed in rNMMS-treated muscles was associated to counteracting muscle atrophy, down-modulating the proteolysis, and increasing the efficacy of nicotinic ACh receptors (AChRs). We did not observe any significant difference in pre- and post-stimulation CMAP amplitudes, evoked by median nerve stimulation. This suggests that the improvement in muscle strength observed in the stimulated arm is unlikely related to reinnervation. The real and sham treatments were well tolerated without evident side effects. Although promising, this is a proof of concept study, without an immediate clinical translation, that requires further clinical validation.. 2019\n",

            "Probing the light scattering properties of insulin secretory granules in single live cells. Light scattering was recently demonstrated to serve as an intrinsic indicator for pancreatic islet cell mass and secretion. The insulin secretory granule (ISG), in particular, was proposed to be a reasonable candidate as the main intracellular source of scattered light due to the densely-packed insulin semi-crystal in the granule lumen. This scenario, if confirmed, would in principle open new perspectives for label-free single-granule imaging, tracking, and analysis. Contrary to such expectations, here we demonstrate that ISGs are not a primary source of scattering in primary human β-cells, as well as in immortalized β-like cells, quantitatively not superior to other intracellular organelles/structures, such as lysosomes and internal membranes. This result is achieved through multi-channel imaging of scattered light along with fluorescence arising from selectively-labelled ISGs. Co-localization and spatiotemporal cross-correlation analysis is performed on these signals, and compared among different cell lines. Obtained results suggest a careful re-thinking of the possibility to exploit intrinsic optical properties originating from ISGs for single-granule imaging purposes.. 2018\n",

Nanomaterials hold great promise in the manipulation and treatments of mesenchymal stem cells, since they allow the modulation of their properties and differentiation. However, systematic studies have to be carried out in order to assess their potential toxicological effects. The present study reports on biocompatibility evaluation of glycol-chitosan coated barium titanate nanoparticles (BTNPs) on rat mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). BTNPs are a class of ceramic systems which possess interesting features for biological applications thanks to their peculiar dielectric and piezoelectric properties. Viability was evaluated up to 5 days of incubation (concentrations in the range 0-100. μg/ml) both quantitatively and qualitatively with specific assays. Interactions cells/nanoparticles were further investigated with analysis of the cytoskeleton conformation, with SEM and TEM imaging, and with AFM analysis. Finally, differentiation in adipocytes and osteocytes was achieved in the presence of high doses of BTNPs, thus highlighting the safety of these nanostructures towards mesenchymal stem cells. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.. 2013\n",
            "Assembly and separation of semiconductor quantum dot dimers and trimers. Repeated precipitation of colloidal semiconductor quantum dots (QD) from a good solvent by adding a poor solvent leads to an increasing number of QD oligomers after redispersion in the good solvent. By using density gradient ultracentrifugation we have been able to separate QD monomer, dimer, and trimer fractions from higher oligomers in such solutions. In the corresponding fractions QD dimers and trimers have been enriched up to 90% and 64%, respectively. Besides directly coupled oligomers, QD dimers and trimers were also assembled by linkage with a rigid terrylene diimide dye (TDI) and separated again by ultracentrifugation. High-resolution transmission electron micrographs show that the interparticle distances are clearly larger than those for directly coupled dots proving that the QDs indeed are cross-linked by the dye. Moreover, energy transfer from the QDs to the TDI \"bridge\" has been observed. Individual oligomers (directly coupled or dye-linked) can be readily deposited on a substrate and studied simultaneously by scanning force and optical microscopy. Our simple and effective scheme is applicable to a wide range of ligand stabilized colloidal nanoparticles and opens the way to a detailed study of electronic coupling in, e.g., QD molecules. © 2011 American Chemical Society.. 2011\n",
            "Depersonalization Affects Self-Prioritization of Bodily, but Not Abstract Self-Related Information. Depersonalization is a common and distressing experience characterized by a feeling of estrangement from one’s self, body, and the world. In order to examine the relationship between depersonalization and selfhood we conducted an experimental study comparing processing of three types of self-related information between nonclinical groups of people experiencing high and low levels of depersonalization. Using a sequential matching task, we compared three types of biases for processing of self-related information: prioritization of one’s name, of self-associated abstract stimuli (geometrical shapes), and of self-associated bodily stimuli (avatar faces). We found that both groups demonstrated the standard pattern of results for self-prioritization of one’s name and geometrical shapes, but they differed with regard to avatar faces. While people with low depersonalization showed the standard prioritization of avatar faces, people with high depersonalization showed overall better response accuracy with avatar faces, and faster response times for stranger-associated avatar faces. These results were complemented by the additional finding that people with high depersonalization reported being more likely to use avatars of a different gender to their own outside of the experimental context. Finally, in this large sample (N= 180) we investigated the relationships between different measures of self-related processing and self-identification, finding no correlation between explicit reports of self-identification with self-associated avatar faces and geometrical shapes, self-prioritization of these stimuli, and prioritization of one’s name.. 2023\n",

Reaction pathways to SnO2 nanomaterials through the hydrolysis of hydrated tin tetrachloride precursors were investigated. The products were prepared solvothermally starting from hydrated tin tetrachloride and various (e.g., alkali) hydroxides. The influence of the precursor base on the final morphology of the nanomaterials was studied. X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) data indicated the formation of rutile-type SnO2. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies revealed different morphologies that were formed with different precursor base cations.

            "Porous g-C3N4-based nanoarchitectures by playing with sustainable precursors: Role of urea/melamine ratio on the structure/properties relationship. In this study, porous g-C3N4 based nanoarchitectures were obtained by a facile and effective in-situ synthesis method, that entailed the thermal treatment of different melamine (M) and urea (U) precursor mass ratios (in particular M/U = 50:50, 20:80), which were then compared with g-C3N4 obtained from pure M and U. The role of the melamine/urea mass ratio on morphology, structure, surface area, porosity, optical and vibrational properties of the g-C3N4 -based materials, was analysed in detail by means of many characterization techniques, including FESEM, AFM, XRD, HRTEM, Raman, FTIR, UV and PL spectroscopies, BET and TGA analyses. It will be shown that samples obtained from different M and U precursor mass ratios combine the advantage of high thermal stability and significant reaction yields, which are due to melamine action, and greatly improved surface area and short migration paths, which are due to urea effect, thus providing the suitable conditions for charge transfer within the interfaces. The results may shed light on effective improvements in the structure/properties of g-C3N4 based nanoarchitectures, aiming at peculiar functional materials.. 2024\n",

Brain-inspired computation and information processing alongside compatibility with neuromorphic hardware have made spiking neural networks (SNN) a promising method for solving learning tasks in machine learning (ML). Spiking neurons are only one of the requirements for building a bio-plausible learning model. Network architecture and learning rules are other important factors to consider when developing such artificial agents. In this work, inspired by the human visual pathway and the role of dopamine in learning, we propose a reward-modulated locally connected spiking neural network, BioLCNet, for visual learning tasks. To extract visual features from Poisson-distributed spike trains, we used local filters that are more analogous to the biological visual system compared to convolutional filters with weight sharing. In the decoding layer, we applied a spike population-based voting scheme to determine the decision of the network. We employed Spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) for learning the visual features, and its reward-modulated variant (R-STDP) for training the decoder based on the reward or punishment feedback signal. For evaluation, we first assessed the robustness of our rewarding mechanism to varying target responses in a classical conditioning experiment. Afterwards, we evaluated the performance of our network on image classification tasks of MNIST and XOR MNIST datasets.. 2023\n",

Aims of this study are to assess the impact of Parkinson's disease on disability and quality of life, to evaluate the relationships between them and NMS prevalence.In this cross-sectional study, adult patients were consecutively enrolled and administered the World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule (WHO-DAS II), the 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) and the Non Motor Symptoms Questionnaire (NMSQuest). One-sample t-test was used to compare WHO-DAS II and SF-36 scores with normative value. Pearson's correlation was performed between NMSQuest, WHO-DAS II and SF-36 summary scales. Independent-sample t-test was used to compare NMSQuest, WHO-DAS II and SF-36 scores in patients with Hoehn & Yahr stage <3 and ≥3. In total, 96 patients were enrolled. SF-36 and WHO-DAS II scores were significantly worse than the normative values. Correlation coefficients between NMSQuest, WHO-DAS II and SF-36's mental score were moderate, and were high between WHO-DAS II and and SF-36's physical score. Patients with Hoehn & Yahr stage≥3 reported reduced quality of life, higher disability and more NMS.Parkinson's disease severity is strongly associated with reduced quality of life, increased disability and NMS prevalence.

Neurons in visual cortex receive most inputs from other cortical neurons with similar stimulus preference. To understand the role of this arrangement in information transmission we use a computational model to quantify the information about external stimuli that a typical cortical neuron receives through its cortico-cortical synapses. We find that efficient readout of the information encoded by an afferent population with orientation tuning similar to that observed in area V1 requires the spread of orientation preferences of excitatory cortical afferents to take a value in agreement with experiments. We suggest that the organization of V1 cortico-cortical synapses allows efficient information transmission. © 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.. 2006\n",
            "Bioinspired hybrid eumelanin-TiO2 antimicrobial nanostructures: the key role of organo-inorganic frameworks in tuning eumelanin's biocide action mechanism through membrane interaction. Intrinsic biocide efficacy of eumelanins can be markedly enhanced through a templated formation in the presence of a TiO2-sol, leading to hybrid TiO2-melanin nanostructures. However, mechanisms and processes behind biocide activity still remain poorly understood. This paper discloses the fundamental mechanism of action of these systems providing mechanistic information on their peculiar interaction with Escherichia coli strains. To this purpose biocide characterization is combined with Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) spectroscopy to investigate radical species produced by the hybrids as well as their interactions with Gram(-) external bacterial membranes. Experimental results indicate that TiO2 mediated eumelanin polymerization leads to a peculiar mechanism of action of hybrid nanostructures, whose strong interactions with bacterial membranes enhance the action of reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by eumelanin degradation itself, also concurring with the final biocide action. These findings provide strategic information for the development of eumelanin-based systems with enhanced activity against drug-resistant strains.. 2018\n",

            "Guest Editorial Special Section on Learning in Non-(geo)metric Spaces. Traditional machine learning and pattern recognition techniques are intimately linked to the notion of feature spaces. Adopting this view, each object is described in terms of a vector of numerical attributes and is, therefore, mapped to a point in a Euclidean (geometric) vector space, so that the distances between the points reflect the observed (dis)similarities between the respective objects. This kind of representation is attractive because geometric spaces offer powerful analytical as well as computational tools that are simply not available in other representations. Indeed, classical machine learning methods are tightly related to geometrical concepts, and numerous powerful tools have been developed during the last few decades, starting from the maximal likelihood method in the 1920s to perceptrons in the 1960s and, more recently, to kernel machines and deep learning architectures.. 2016\n",

            "Secondary somatosensory and posterior insular cortices: a somatomotor hub for object prehension and manipulation movements. The secondary somatosensory cortex (SII) and posterior insular cortex (pIC) are recognized for processing touch and movement information during hand manipulation in humans and non-human primates. However, their involvement in three-dimensional (3D) object manipulation remains unclear. To investigate neural activity related to hand manipulation in the SII/pIC, we trained two macaque monkeys to grasp three objects (a cone, a plate, and a ring) and engage in visual fixation on the object. Our results revealed that 19.4% (n = 50/257) of the task-related neurons in SII/pIC were active during hand manipulations, but did not respond to passive somatosensory stimuli. Among these neurons, 44% fired before hand-object contact (reaching to grasping neurons), 30% maintained tonic activity after contact (holding neurons), and 26% showed continuous discharge before and after contact (non-selective neurons). Object grasping-selectivity varied and was weak among these neurons, with only 24% responding to fixation of a 3D object (visuo-motor neurons). Even neurons unresponsive to passive visual stimuli showed responses to set-related activity before the onset of movement (42%, n = 21/50). Our findings suggest that somatomotor integration within SII/pIC is probably integral to all prehension sequences, including reaching, grasping, and object manipulation movements. Moreover, the existence of a set-related activity within SII/pIC may play a role in directing somatomotor attention during object prehension-manipulation in the absence of vision. Overall, SII/pIC may play a role as a somatomotor hub within the lateral grasping network that supports the generation of intentional hand actions based on haptic information.. 2024\n",

            "Similarities and Differences in Ligand Binding to Protein and RNA Targets: The Case of Riboflavin. It is nowadays clear that RNA molecules can play active roles in several biological processes. As a result, an increasing number of RNAs are gradually being identified as potentially druggable targets. In particular, noncoding RNAs can adopt highly organized conformations that are suitable for drug binding. However, RNAs are still considered challenging targets due to their complex structural dynamics and high charge density. Thus, elucidating relevant features of drug-RNA binding is fundamental for advancing drug discovery. Here, by using Molecular Dynamics simulations, we compare key features of ligand binding to proteins with those observed in RNA. Specifically, we explore similarities and differences in terms of (i) conformational flexibility of the target, (ii) electrostatic contribution to binding free energy, and (iii) water and ligand dynamics. As a test case, we examine binding of the same ligand, namely riboflavin, to protein and RNA targets, specifically the riboflavin (RF) kinase and flavin mononucleotide (FMN) riboswitch. The FMN riboswitch exhibited enhanced fluctuations and explored a wider conformational space, compared to the protein target, underscoring the importance of RNA flexibility in ligand binding. Conversely, a similar electrostatic contribution to the binding free energy of riboflavin was found. Finally, greater stability of water molecules was observed in the FMN riboswitch compared to the RF kinase, possibly due to the different shape and polarity of the pockets.. 2024\n",

Spontaneous Raman (SR) microscopy allows label-free chemically specific imaging based on the vibrational response of molecules; however, due to the low Raman scattering cross section, it is intrinsically slow.

Free-standing films have been obtained by drop-casting cellulose-glycerol mixtures (up to 50 wt% glycerol) dissolved in trifluoroacetic acid and trifluoroacetic anhydride (TFA:TFAA, 2:1, v:v). A comprehensive examination of the optical, structural, mechanical, thermal, hydrodynamic, barrier, migration, greaseproof, and biodegradation characteristics of the films was conducted. The resulting cellulose-glycerol blends exhibited an amorphous molecular structure and a reinforced H-bond network, as evidenced by X-ray diffraction analysis and infrared spectroscopy, respectively. The inclusion of glycerol exerted a plasticizing influence on the mechanical properties of the films, while keeping their transparency. Hydrodynamic and barrier properties were assessed through water uptake and water vapor/oxygen transmission rates, respectively, and obtained values were consistent with those of other cellulose-based materials. Furthermore, overall migration levels were below European regulation limits, as stated by using Tenax® as a dry food simulant. In addition, these bioplastics demonstrated good greaseproof performance, particularly at high glycerol content, and potential as packaging materials for bakery products.

            "m6A modification inhibits miRNAs’ intracellular function, favoring their extracellular export for intercellular communication. Epitranscriptomics represents a further layer of gene expression regulation. Specifically, N6-methyladenosine (m6A) regulates RNA maturation, stability, degradation, and translation. Regarding microRNAs (miRNAs), while it has been reported that m6A impacts their biogenesis, the functional effects on mature miRNAs remain unclear. Here, we show that m6A modification on specific miRNAs weakens their coupling to AGO2, impairs their function on target mRNAs, determines their delivery into extracellular vesicles (EVs), and provides functional information to receiving cells. Mechanistically, the intracellular functional impairment is caused by m6A-mediated inhibition of AGO2/miRNA interaction, the EV loading is favored by m6A-mediated recognition by the RNA-binding protein (RBP) hnRNPA2B1, and the EV-miRNA function in the receiving cell requires their FTO-mediated demethylation. Consequently, cells express specific miRNAs that do not impact endogenous transcripts but provide regulatory information for cell-to-cell communication. This highlights that a further level of complexity should be considered when relating cellular dynamics to specific miRNAs.. 2024\n",
            "A Knock-In Mouse Model of Thymoma With the GTF2I L424H Mutation. Introduction: The pathogenesis of thymic epithelial tumors remains largely unknown. We previously identified GTF2I L424H as the most frequently recurrent mutation in thymic epithelial tumors. Nevertheless, the precise role of this mutation in tumorigenesis of thymic epithelial cells is unclear. Methods: To investigate the role of GTF2I L424H mutation in thymic epithelial cells in vivo, we generated and characterized a mouse model in which the Gtf2i L424H mutation was conditionally knocked-in in the Foxn1+ thymic epithelial cells. Digital spatial profiling was performed on thymomas and normal thymic tissues with GeoMx-mouse whole transcriptome atlas. Immunohistochemistry staining was performed using both mouse tissues and human thymic epithelial tumors. Results: We observed that the Gtf2i mutation impairs development of the thymic medulla and maturation of medullary thymic epithelial cells in young mice and causes tumor formation in the thymus of aged mice. Cell cycle-related pathways, such as E2F targets and MYC targets, are enriched in the tumor epithelial cells. Results of gene set variation assay analysis revealed that gene signatures of cortical thymic epithelial cells and thymic epithelial progenitor cells are also enriched in the thymomas of the knock-in mice, which mirrors the human counterparts in The Cancer Genome Atlas database.

            "Entropy-Suppressed Ferroelectricity in Hybrid Lead-Iodide Perovskites. The actual nature of the electric polarization in hybrid lead-iodide perovskites is unveiled on the basis of ab initio and model results. A finite, albeit small electric polarization of few μC/cm2 is found to be pervasive in this system, due to the polar-uncompensated alignment of methylammonium dimers, at least for temperature lower than the activation energy of dimer rotations; however, the presence of a large number of structural local minima corresponding to differently oriented polarization directions counteracts the stabilization of an ordered ferroelectric phase at the macroscale. According to our estimate, only for temperatures lower than 40-50 K a clear ferroelectric behavior is displayed. At higher temperature the polarization is progressively suppressed and the ferroelectric ordering hindered by the large configurational entropy, giving rise to a superparaelectric-like behavior at the macroscale.. 2015\n",
            "Exciton-photocarrier interference in mixed lead-halide-perovskite nanocrystals. The use of semiconductor nanocrystals in scalable quantum technologies requires characterization of the exciton coherence dynamics in an ensemble of electronically isolated crystals in which system-bath interactions are nevertheless strong. In this communication, we identify signatures of Fano-like interference between excitons and photocarriers in the coherent two-dimensional photoluminescence excitation spectral lineshapes of mixed lead-halide perovskite nanocrystals in dilute solution. Specifically, by tuning the femtosecond-pulse spectrum, we show such interference in an intermediate coupling regime, which is evident in the coherent lineshape when simultaneously exciting the exciton and the free-carrier band at higher energy. We conclude that this interference is an intrinsic effect that will be consequential in the quantum dynamics of the system and will thus dictate decoherence dynamics, with consequences in their application in quantum technologies.. 2024\n",
            "Wisdom of Crowds for Supporting the Safety Evaluation of Nanomaterials. The development of new approach methodologies (NAMs) to replace current in vivo testing for the safety assessment of engineered nanomaterials (ENMs) is hindered by the scarcity of validated experimental data for many ENMs. We introduce a framework to address this challenge by harnessing the collective expertise of professionals from multiple complementary and related fields (“wisdom of crowds” or WoC). By integrating expert insights, we aim to fill data gaps and generate consensus concern scores for diverse ENMs, thereby enhancing the predictive power of nanosafety computational models. Our investigation reveals an alignment between expert opinion and experimental data, providing robust estimations of concern levels. Building upon these findings, we employ predictive machine learning models trained on the newly defined concern scores, ENM descriptors, and gene expression profiles, to quantify potential harm across various toxicity end points. These models further reveal key genes potentially involved in underlying toxicity mechanisms. Notably, genes associated with metal ion homeostasis, inflammation, and oxidative stress emerge as predictors of ENM toxicity across diverse end points. This study showcases the value of integrating expert knowledge and computational modeling to support more efficient, mechanism-informed, and scalable safety assessment of nanomaterials in the rapidly evolving landscape of nanotechnology.. 2025\n",
            "Airway Natural Killer Cells and Bacteria in Health and Disease. Natural killer (NK) cells are innate lymphoid cells at the interface between innate and adaptive immunity and mostly studied for their important roles in viral infections and malignant tumors. They can kill diseased cells and produce cytokines and chemokines, thereby shaping the adaptive immune response. Nowadays, NK cells are considered as a strong weapon for cancer immunotherapy and can for example be transduced to express tumor-specific chimeric antigen receptors or harnessed with therapeutic antibodies such as the so-called NK engagers. Whereas a large body of literature exists about the antiviral and antitumoral properties of NK cells, their potential role in bacterial infections is not that well delineated. Furthermore, NK cells are much more heterogeneous than previously thought and have tissue-characteristic features and phenotypes. This review gives an overview of airway NK cells and their position within the immunological army dressed against bacterial infections in the upper and predominantly the lower respiratory tracts. Whereas it appears that in several infections, NK cells play a non-redundant and protective role, they can likewise act as rather detrimental. The use of mouse models and the difficulty of access to human airway tissues for ethical reasons might partly explain the divergent results. However, new methods are appearing that are likely to reduce the heterogeneity between studies and to give a more coherent picture in this field.. 2020\n",

            "A network model of Italy shows that intermittent regional strategies can alleviate the COVID-19 epidemic. The COVID-19 epidemic hit Italy particularly hard, yielding the implementation of strict national lockdown rules. Previous modelling studies at the national level overlooked the fact that Italy is divided into administrative regions which can independently oversee their own share of the Italian National Health Service. Here, we show that heterogeneity between regions is essential to understand the spread of the epidemic and to design effective strategies to control the disease. We model Italy as a network of regions and parameterize the model of each region on real data spanning over two months from the initial outbreak. We confirm the effectiveness at the regional level of the national lockdown strategy and propose coordinated regional interventions to prevent future national lockdowns, while avoiding saturation of the regional health systems and mitigating impact on costs. Our study and methodology can be easily extended to other levels of granularity to support policy- and decision-makers.. 2020\n",
            "Report on a Milking Mule: Milk Qualitative Characteristics during Lactation. Despite their inability to reproduce naturally, mules can host embryos and be surrogate dams. The aim of this investigation was to increase our knowledge of the qualitative composition of mule’s milk and its variations throughout the whole lactation period—namely, from 6 h after foaling to 180 days in milk (DIM). Milk was obtained from a mule dam that had foaled after receiving a mule embryo transfer. For each sample, the gross, mineral, and fatty acid composition was evaluated. The average quality of the mule milk was as follows: protein 1.97 g 100 mL−1, fat 0.90 g 100 mL−1, and ash 0.39 g 100 mL−1. Saturated fatty acids made up, on average, 50.00 g 100 g−1 of fat. Monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids made up half of the total fatty acid content (31.80 g 100 g−1 and 18.2 g 100 g−1 of fat, respectively). Linoleic acid and linolenic acid were the main polyunsaturated fatty acids in the milk. The milk composition changed throughout lactation. Dry matter, protein, fat, and ash decreased significantly from early lactation (6 h to 14 DIM). The n3 polyunsaturated fatty acids decreased at the end of lactation. The changes in milk composition throughout lactation are probably due to adaptations to the growth requirements of the foal.. 2024\n",
            "A grasping approach based on superquadric models. This paper addresses the problem of grasping unknown objects with a humanoid robot. Conventional approaches fail when the shape, dimension or pose of the objects are missing. We propose a novel approach in which the grasping problem is solved by modeling the object and the volume graspable by the hand with superquadric functions. The object model is computed in real-time using stereo vision. Pose computation is formulated as a nonlinear constrained optimization problem, which is solved in real-time using the Ipopt software package. Notably, our method finds solutions in which the fingers are located on portions of the object that are occluded by vision. The performance of our approach has been assessed on a real robotic system, the iCub humanoid robot. The experiments show that the proposed method computes proper poses, suitable for grasping even small objects, while avoiding hitting the table with the fingers.. 2017\n",

            "Assessing Specific Networks of Chromatin Interactions with HiChIP. The introduction of chromosome conformation capture (3C)-based technologies coupled with next-generation sequencing have significantly advanced our understanding of how the genetic material is organized within the eukaryotic nucleus. Three-dimensional (3D) genomic organization occurs at hierarchical levels, ranging from chromosome territories and subnuclear compartments to smaller self-associated domains and fine-scale chromatin interactions. The latter can be further categorized into different subtypes, such as structural or regulatory, based either on their presumed functionality and/or the factors that mediate their formation. Various enrichment strategies coupled with 3C-based technologies have been developed to prospectively isolate and quantify chromatin interactions around regions occupied by specific proteins or marks of interest. These approaches not only enable high-resolution characterization of the selected chromatin contacts at a cost-effective manner, but also offer important biological insights into their organizational principles and regulatory function. In this chapter, we will focus on the recently developed HiChIP technology with an emphasis on the discovery of putative active enhancers and promoter interactions in cell types of interest. We will describe the specific steps for designing, performing and analyzing successful HiChIP experiments as well as important limitations and considerations.. 2022\n",

            "Overcoming temperature polarization in membrane distillation by thermoplasmonic effects activated by Ag nanofillers in polymeric membranes. In recent years, Membrane Distillation (MD) has emerged either as a promising alternative or as a complement to Reverse Osmosis (RO) in seawater desalination. However, the performance of MD is significantly offset by temperature polarization, a phenomenon intrinsically related to water evaporation that causes the decrease of the solution temperature at the membrane surface and, ultimately, the loss of driving force. In this work, we show that temperature polarization can be withdrawn by exploiting thermal collective effects activated by the excitation of plasmonic modes in UV-irradiated Mixed Matrix Membranes composed of silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) incorporated in polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) microporous films. For experimental tests carried out under vacuum (VMD) and with an absorbed radiant heating power of 2.3 · 104 W/m2, best results were obtained using PVDF membranes loaded with 25%Ag NPs. In this case, measured transmembrane fluxes to pure water and 0.5 M NaCl solution were 32.2 and 25.7 L/m2 h, respectively, i.e. about 11- and 9- fold higher than the corresponding values for unloaded membranes. Remarkably, energy analysis revealed that the heat generation of Ag NPs under plasmonic resonance was able to withdrawn temperature polarization, resulting in estimated temperature polarization factor (TPF) values of 106.5% for 0.5 M NaCl solution.. 2019\n",
            "Soft Robotics: A Route to Equality, Diversity, and Inclusivity in Robotics. Robotics is entering our daily lives. The discipline is increasingly crucial in fields such as agriculture, medicine, and rescue operations, impacting our food, health, and planet. At the same time, it is becoming evident that robotic research must embrace and reflect the diversity of human society to address these broad challenges effectively. In recent years, gender inclusivity has received increasing attention, but it still remains a distant goal. In addition, awareness is rising around other dimensions of diversity, including nationality, religion, and politics. Unfortunately, despite the efforts, empirical evidence shows that the field has still a long way to go before achieving a sufficient level of equality, diversity, and inclusion across these spectra. This study focuses on the soft robotics community—a growing and relatively recent subfield—and it outlines the present state of equality and diversity panorama in this discipline. The article argues that its high interdisciplinary and accessibility make it a particularly welcoming branch of robotics. We discuss the elements that make this subdiscipline an example for the broader robotic field. At the same time, we recognize that the field should still improve in several ways and become more inclusive and diverse. We propose concrete actions that we believe will contribute to achieving this goal, and provide metrics to monitor its evolution.. 2024\n",

            "Misleading Robot Signals in a Classification Task Induce Cognitive Load as Measured by Theta Synchronization Between Frontal and Temporo-parietal Brain Regions. As technological advances progress, we find ourselves in situations where we need to collaborate with artificial agents (e.g., robots, autonomous machines and virtual agents). For example, autonomous machines will be part of search and rescue missions, space exploration and decision aids during monitoring tasks (e.g., baggage-screening at the airport). Efficient communication in these scenarios would be crucial to interact fluently. While studies examined the positive and engaging effect of social signals (i.e., gaze communication) on human-robot interaction, little is known about the effects of conflicting robot signals on the human actor's cognitive load. Moreover, it is unclear from a social neuroergonomics perspective how different brain regions synchronize or communicate with one another to deal with the cognitive load induced by conflicting signals in social situations with robots. The present study asked if neural oscillations that correlate with conflict processing are observed between brain regions when participants view conflicting robot signals. Participants classified different objects based on their color after a robot (i.e., iCub), presented on a screen, simulated handing over the object to them. The robot proceeded to cue participants (with a head shift) to the correct or incorrect target location. Since prior work has shown that unexpected cues can interfere with oculomotor planning and induces conflict, we expected that conflicting robot social signals which would interfere with the execution of actions. Indeed, we found that conflicting social signals elicited neural correlates of cognitive conflict as measured by mid-brain theta oscillations. More importantly, we found higher coherence values between mid-frontal electrode locations and posterior occipital electrode locations in the theta-frequency band for incongruent vs. congruent cues, which suggests that theta-band synchronization between these two regions allows for communication between cognitive control systems and gaze-related attentional mechanisms. We also find correlations between coherence values and behavioral performance (Reaction Times), which are moderated by the congruency of the robot signal. In sum, the influence of irrelevant social signals during goal-oriented tasks can be indexed by behavioral, neural oscillation and brain connectivity patterns. These data provide insights about a new measure for cognitive load, which can also be used in predicting human interaction with autonomous machines.. 2022\n",

            "Gene Transfection Efficiency Improvement with Lipid Conjugated Cationic Carbon Dots. An ideal vehicle with a high transfection efficiency is crucial for gene delivery. In this study, a type of cationic carbon dot (CCD) known as APCDs were first prepared with arginine (Arg) and pentaethylenehexamine (PEHA) as precursors and conjugated with oleic acid (OA) for gene delivery. By tuning the mass ratio of APCDs to OA, APCDs-OA conjugates, namely, APCDs-0.5OA, APCDs-1.0OA, and APCDs-1.5OA were synthesized. All three amphiphilic APCDs-OA conjugates show high affinity to DNA through electrostatic interactions. APCDs-0.5OA exhibit strong binding with small interfering RNA (siRNA). After being internalized by Human Embryonic Kidney (HEK 293) and osteosarcoma (U2OS) cells, they could distribute in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus. With APCDs-OA conjugates as gene delivery vehicles, plasmid DNA (pDNA) that encodes the gene for the green fluorescence protein (GFP) can be successfully delivered in both HEK 293 and U2OS cells. The GFP expression levels mediated by APCDs-0.5OA and APCDs-1.0OA are ten times greater than that of PEI in HEK 293 cells. Furthermore, APCDs-0.5OA show prominent siRNA transfection efficiency, which is proven by the significantly downregulated expression of FANCA and FANCD2 proteins upon delivery of FANCA siRNA and FANCD2 siRNA into U2OS cells. In conclusion, our work demonstrates that conjugation of CCDs with a lipid structure such as OA significantly improves the gene transfection efficiency, providing a new idea about the designation of nonviral carriers in gene delivery systems.. 2024\n",
            "Neuronal hemoglobin affects dopaminergic cells' response to stress. Hemoglobin (Hb) is the major protein in erythrocytes and carries oxygen (O2) throughout the body. Recently, Hb has been found synthesized in atypical sites, including the brain. Hb is highly expressed in A9 dopaminergic (DA) neurons of the substantia nigra (SN), whose selective degeneration leads to Parkinson's disease (PD). Here we show that Hb confers DA cells' susceptibility to 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP +) and rotenone, neurochemical cellular models of PD. The toxic property of Hb does not depend on O2 binding and is associated with insoluble aggregate formation in the nucleolus. Neurochemical stress induces epigenetic modifications, nucleolar alterations and autophagy inhibition that depend on Hb expression. When adeno-associated viruses carrying α-and β-chains of Hb are stereotaxically injected into mouse SN, Hb forms aggregates and causes motor learning impairment. These results position Hb as a potential player in DA cells' homeostasis and dysfunction in PD.. 2017\n",

Interfacial solar desalination is an emerging technology for freshwater production, but the finding of novel solar evaporators is still challenging. In the present research, graphitic carbon foam (CF) was synthesized from the upcycling of waste plastic polyethylene terephthalate (PET) waste bottles functionalized with carrollite CuCo2S4 as a photothermal layer. Analytical characterization [X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive spectroscopy (SEM-EDS)] confirms the functionalization of carrollite CuCo2S4 on graphitic carbon foam. The UV-Vis spectroscopy analysis showed an enhanced optical absorption in the UV-Vis-near IR region (>96%) for functionalized CuCo2S4-CF foam compared to carbon foam (67%). The interfacial solar desalination experiment presented a significantly enhanced evaporation rate of 2.4 kg·m−2·h−1 for CuCo2S4-CF compared to that of CF (1.60 kg·m−2·h−1) and that of CuCo2S4 (1.60 kg·m−2·h−1).

One of the critical aspects in the design of an assistive wearable robot is the energy efficiency of the actuation system, since it significantly affects the weight and consequently the comfort of the system. Several strategies have been used in previous research, mostly based on energy harvesting, compliant elements for mechanical energy accumulation (springs or elastic cords), ratchets, and clutches. However, the design of the optimal actuator arrangement is highly dependent on the task, which increases significantly the complexity of the design process. In this letter, we present an energy efficiency analysis and design optimization of an actuation system applied to a soft module lower limb exoskeleton. Instead of performing a comparison between predefined mechanism arrangements, we solve a full optimization problem that includes not only the mechanism parameters, but also the mechanism architecture itself. The optimization is performed for a walking task using gait data from a stroke subject, and the result is a set of actuator arrangements with optimal parameters for the analyzed task and selected user. The optimized mechanism is able to reduce the energy requirements by 20-65%, depending on the joint.

Magnetic shape memory materials hold a great promise for next-generation actuation devices and systems for energy conversion, thanks to the intimate coupling between structure and magnetism in their martensitic phase. Here novel magnetic shape memory free-standing nanodisks are proposed, proving that the lack of the substrate constrains enables the exploitation of new microstructure-controlled actuation mechanisms by the combined application of different stimuli–i.e., temperature and magnetic field. The results show that a reversible areal strain (up to 5.5%) can be achieved and tuned in intensity and sign (i.e., areal contraction or expansion) by the application of a magnetic field. The mechanisms at the basis of the actuation are investigated by experiments performed at different length scales and directly visualized by several electron microscopy techniques, including electron holography, showing that thermo/magnetomechanical properties can be optimized by engineering the martensitic microstructure through epitaxial growth and lateral confinement.

Recently, the method of choice to exploit robot dynamics for efficient walking is numerical optimization (NO).

Several strategies can be used to make the optimization more treatable and to efficiently describe the solution set. In this letter, we present an algorithm to encode effective walking references, generated offline via numerical optimization, extracting a limited number of principal components and using them as a basis of optimal motions. By combining these components, a good approximation of the optimal gaits can be generated at run time.

            "Molecular Mechanism of Sirtuin 1 Inhibition by Human Immunodeficiency Virus 1 Tat Protein. Sirtuins are NAD+-dependent protein lysine deacylases implicated in metabolic regulation and aging-related dysfunctions. The nuclear isoform Sirt1 deacetylates histones and transcription factors and contributes, e.g., to brain and immune cell functions. Upon infection by human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV1), Sirt1 deacetylates the viral transactivator of transcription (Tat) protein to promote the expression of the viral genome. Tat, in turn, inhibits Sirt1, leading to the T cell hyperactivation associated with HIV infection. Here, we describe the molecular mechanism of Tat-dependent sirtuin inhibition. Using Tat-derived peptides and recombinant Tat protein, we mapped the inhibitory activity to Tat residues 34–59, comprising Tat core and basic regions and including the Sirt1 deacetylation site Lys50. Tat binds to the sirtuin catalytic core and inhibits Sirt1, Sirt2, and Sirt3 with comparable potencies. Biochemical data and crystal structures of sirtuin complexes with Tat peptides reveal that Tat exploits its intrinsically extended basic region for binding to the sirtuin substrate binding cleft through substrate-like β-strand interactions, supported by charge complementarity. Tat Lys50 is positioned in the sirtuin substrate lysine pocket, although binding and inhibition do not require prior acetylation and rely on subtle differences to the binding of regular substrates. Our results provide mechanistic insights into sirtuin regulation by Tat, improving our understanding of physiological sirtuin regulation and the role of this interaction during HIV1 infection.. 2023\n",

We present the first multi-wavelength follow-up observations of two candidate gravitational-wave (GW) transient events recorded by LIGO and Virgo in their 2009-2010 science run. The events were selected with low latency by the network of GW detectors (within less than 10 minutes) and their candidate sky locations were observed by the Swift observatory (within 12 hr). Image transient detection was used to analyze the collected electromagnetic data, which were found to be consistent with background. Off-line analysis of the GW data alone has also established that the selected GW events show no evidence of an astrophysical origin; one of them is consistent with background and the other one was a test, part of a \"blind injection challenge.\" With this work we demonstrate the feasibility of rapid follow-ups of GW transients and establish the sensitivity improvement joint electromagnetic and GW observations could bring. This is a first step toward an electromagnetic follow-up program in the regime of routine detections with the advanced GW instruments expected within this decade. In that regime, multi-wavelength observations will play a significant role in completing the astrophysical identification of GW sources.

            "Molecular Mechanism of Sirtuin 1 Modulation by the AROS Protein. The protein lysine deacylases of the NAD+-dependent Sirtuin family contribute to metabolic regulation, stress responses, and aging processes, and the human Sirtuin isoforms, Sirt1-7, are considered drug targets for aging-related diseases. The nuclear isoform Sirt1 deacetylates histones and transcription factors to regulate, e.g., metabolic adaptations and circadian mechanisms, and it is used as a therapeutic target for Huntington’s disease and psoriasis. Sirt1 is regulated through a multitude of mechanisms, including the interaction with regulatory proteins such as the inhibitors Tat and Dbc1 or the activator AROS. Here, we describe a molecular characterization of AROS and how it regulates Sirt1. We find that AROS is a partly intrinsically disordered protein (IDP) that inhibits rather than activates Sirt1. A biochemical characterization of the interaction including binding and stability assays, NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and a crystal structure of Sirtuin/AROS peptide complex reveal that AROS acts as a competitive inhibitor, through binding to the Sirt1 substrate peptide site. Our results provide molecular insights in the physiological regulation of Sirt1 by a regulator protein and suggest the peptide site as an opportunity for Sirt1-targeted drug development.. 2022\n",

This is even truer if a downscaled, short channel is adopted. Only if contacts are able to provide the device with as much charge as it needs, with a negligible voltage drop across them, then high expectations can turn into high performances. It is a fact that this is not always the case in the field of organic electronics. In this review, we aim to offer a comprehensive overview on the subject of current injection in organic thin film transistors: physical principles concerning energy level (mis)alignment at interfaces, models describing charge injection, technologies for interface tuning, and techniques for characterizing devices. Finally, a survey of the most recent accomplishments in the field is given. Principles are described in general, but the technologies and survey emphasis is on solution processed transistors, because it is our opinion that scalable, roll-to-roll printing processing is one, if not the brightest, possible scenario for the future of organic electronics. With the exception of electrolyte-gated organic transistors, where impressively low width normalized resistances were reported (in the range of 10 Ω·cm), to date the lowest values reported for devices where the semiconductor is solution-processed and where the most common architectures are adopted, are ∼10 kΩ·cm for transistors with a field effect mobility in the 0.1-1 cm 2/Vs range. Although these values represent the best case, they still pose a severe limitation for downscaling the channel lengths below a few micrometers, necessary for increasing the device switching speed. Moreover, techniques to lower contact resistances have been often developed on a case-by-case basis, depending on the materials, architecture and processing techniques. The lack of a standard strategy has hampered the progress of the field for a long time. Only recently, as the understanding of the rather complex physical processes at the metal/semiconductor interfaces has improved, more general approaches, with a validity that extends to several materials, are being proposed and successfully tested in the literature. Only a combined scientific and technological effort, on the one side to fully understand contact phenomena and on the other to completely master the tailoring of interfaces, will enable the development of advanced organic electronics applications and their widespread adoption in low-cost, large-area printed circuits.

            "The Protective Effect of Remote Renal Preconditioning Against Hippocampal Ischemia Reperfusion Injury: Role of KATP Channels. Remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC), which consists of several brief ischemia/reperfusion applied at the remote site of lethal ischemia reperfusion, can, through activating different mechanisms, increase the ability of the body’s endogenous protection against prolonged ischemia/reperfusion. Recent studies have shown that RIPC has neuroprotective effects, but its mechanisms are not well elucidated. The present study aimed to determine whether activation of KATP channels in remote renal preconditioning decreases hippocampus damage induced by global cerebral ischemia. RIPC was induced by ischemia of the left renal artery (IPC); 24 h later, global cerebral ischemia reperfusion (IR) was induced by common carotid arteries occlusion. 5hydroxydecanoate (5HD) and glibenclamide (Gli) were injected before of IPC. The levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and catalase (CAT) activity were assessed in hippocampus. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling (TUNEL) was assessed to detect apoptotic cells in hippocampus. RIPC inhibited apoptosis by decreasing positive TUNEL cells (P < 0.05). KATP channels blocking with 5HD and Gli markedly increased apoptosis in hippocampal cells in RIPC group (P < 0.001). RIPC decreased MDA level and increased CAT activity in ischemic hippocampus (P < 0.01). Also, 5HD and Gli inhibited the effect of RIPC on MDA level and CAT activity (P < 0.05). The present study shows that RIPC can effectively attenuate programmed cell death, increase activity of CAT, and reduce MDA levels. Blocking of KATP channels inhibited the protective effects of RIPC.. 2015\n",

Cellulose is probably one of the most extensively investigated polymers: the interest for this abundant and renewable raw material spread at the beginning of the last century and renewed over the past 10 years in the frame of the conversion of the present petrol-based economy to an integrated bio-economy. In this context, cellulose has a major role to play, not only because of its availability and fascinating properties (biodegradability, biocompatibility, low density, high mechanical properties, etc.), but also because, unlike other raw materials such as starch, it is not edible so its use does not compete with human nutrition.. 2015\n",
            "Crystal structure of human CDC7 kinase in complex with its activator DBF4. CDC7 is a serine/threonine kinase that is essential for the initiation of eukaryotic DNA replication. CDC7 activity is controlled by its activator, DBF4. Here we present crystal structures of human CDC7-DBF4 in complex with a nucleotide or ATP-competing small molecules, revealing the active and inhibited forms of the kinase, respectively. DBF4 wraps around CDC7, burying approximately 6,000 Å 2 of hydrophobic molecular surface in a bipartite interface. The effector domain of DBF4, containing conserved motif C, is essential and sufficient to support CDC7 kinase activity by binding to the kinase N-terminal lobe and stabilizing its canonical αC helix. DBF4 motif M latches onto the C-terminal lobe of the kinase, acting as a tethering domain. Our results elucidate the structural basis for binding to and activation of CDC7 by DBF4 and provide a framework for the design of more potent and specific CDC7 inhibitors. © 2012 Nature America, Inc.

            "Addressing climate change with behavioral science: A global intervention tournament in 63 countries. Effectively reducing climate change requires marked, global behavior change. However, it is unclear which strategies are most likely to motivate people to change their climate beliefs and behaviors. Here, we tested 11 expert-crowdsourced interventions on four climate mitigation outcomes: beliefs, policy support, information sharing intention, and an effortful tree-planting behavioral task. Across 59,440 participants from 63 countries, the interventions’ effectiveness was small, largely limited to nonclimate skeptics, and differed across outcomes: Beliefs were strengthened mostly by decreasing psychological distance (by 2.3%), policy support by writing a letter to a future-generation member (2.6%), information sharing by negative emotion induction (12.1%), and no intervention increased the more effortful behavior—several interventions even reduced tree planting. Last, the effects of each intervention differed depending on people’s initial climate beliefs. These findings suggest that the impact of behavioral climate interventions varies across audiences and target behaviors.. 2024\n",

            "White light from blue: White emitting organic LEDs based on spin coated blends of blue-emitting molecules. White light emission can be obtained from spin-coated blends of two different blue-emitting organic molecules, due to the combination of exciplex formation and residual blue emission. Light-emitting diodes using a blend of 90% N,N′-bis(3-methylphenyl)-N,N′-diphenylbenzidine and 10% 2,5-bis(trimethylsilyl thiophene)-1,1-dioxide emits white light with Commision Internationale l'Eclairage co-ordinates of x = 0.34, y = 0.38, close to the equal energy point. We show that exciplex formation does not occur in all relative concentrations of the two components, and we relate this to phase separation in spin coated films, as measured using atomic force microscopy. We suggest that a limit to exciplex formation may be structural, i.e. where the structure and/or morphology of the solid state blend does not allow significant spacial overlap between the HOMO/LUMO of the two components. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

ZnSe-GaAs(001) heterostructures were fabricated by molecular beam epitaxy at 290°C employing different Zn/Se flux ratios. Se-rich growth conditions resulted in a Se-rich interface composition and lower valence band offsets (as low as 0.6 eV). Zn-rich conditions yielded a Zn-rich interface composition, and higher valence band offsets (as high as 1.2 eV). Improved optical properties of the ZnSe overlayers were achieved by employing non-stoichiometric growth conditions only in the early stages of growth (∼ 2 nm). © 1995, All rights reserved.. 1995\n",
            "Evaluation of the [C(sp3)]/[C(sp2)] ratio in diamondlike films through the use of a complex dielectric constant. The evaluation of the amount of tetrahedral and trigonal cross-linking, that is, the sp3- and sp2-hybridized carbon, is of great importance in understanding the properties of amorphous carbon films. In this paper we report a method for deducing the [sp3]/[sp2] ratio from the experimental values of the complex dielectric constant as obtained by optical transmittance and reflectance measurements. We assume a Gaussian-like distribution of and * electronic densities of states in order to fit the contribution of * to the imaginary part, 2, of the dielectric constant in the low-energy region. Through the Kramers-Kronig relationships we deduce the corresponding values of the real part 1 of the dielectric constant for such transitions. By subtracting these values from the measured 1 we deduce the contribution of * to 1. The Wemple-Didomenico model has been used to obtain the dispersion energy and the average excitation energy. Knowing the plasmon energies, we apply the f-sum rule to deduce the [sp3]/[sp2] ratio. The method applied to a-C:H films deposited by rf diode sputtering provides results in agreement with those obtained by other techniques. © 1992 The American Physical Society.. 1992\n",
            "Influence of doping on the structural and optoelectronic properties of amorphous and microcrystalline silicon carbide. Amorphous and microcrystalline silicon carbide, undoped and doped, has attracted a great attention for its optical and electrical properties. The introduction of dopant atoms in the network of amorphous films permits the control of electrical properties but it gives rise to a decreasing of the optical gap. Microcrystalline SiC:H films seem to provide films having a wide range of electrical conductivities without drastic change in the optical gap. This paper presents the results of a detailed study on the effects of boron and phosphorus doping on structural, optical, and electrical properties of a-SiC:H and μc-SiC:H films.

The effect of the inclusion of silicon atoms in the network of diamond-like carbon (amorphous carbon and hydrogenated amorphous carbon) is studied. Samples of amorphous hydrogenated CSi are deposited by means of a sputter-assisted plasma chemical vapour deposition system in which a carbon target is sputtered in an atmosphere composed of silane-diluted argon, where the silane flow rate is varied. It is shown that initially the effect of silicon inclusion is to reduce the size of the graphitic-like islands. When the amount of silicon is increased over a critical value, the network assumes the characteristic of the semiconductor-type amorphous hydrogenated SiC, where the properties of silicon are predominant. © 1992.. 1992\n",
            "Radially and Azimuthally Pure Vortex Beams from Phase-Amplitude Metasurfaces. To exploit the full potential of the transverse spatial structure of light using the Laguerre-Gaussian basis, it is necessary to control the azimuthal and radial components of the photons. Vortex phase elements are commonly used to generate these modes of light, offering precise control over the azimuthal index but neglecting the radially dependent amplitude term, which defines their associated corresponding transverse profile. Here, we experimentally demonstrate the generation of high-purity Laguerre-Gaussian beams with a single-step on-axis transformation implemented with a dielectric phase-amplitude metasurface. By vectorially structuring the input beam and projecting it onto an orthogonal polarization basis, we can sculpt any vortex beam in phase and amplitude. We characterize the azimuthal and radial purities of the generated vortex beams, reaching a purity of 98% for a vortex beam with l =50 and p = 0. Furthermore, we comparatively show that the purity of the generated vortex beams outperforms those generated with other well-established phase-only metasurface approaches. In addition, we highlight the formation of “ghost” orbital angular momentum orders from azimuthal gratings (analogous to ghost orders in ruled gratings), which have not been widely studied to date. Our work brings higher-order vortex beams and their unlimited potential within reach of wide adoption.. 2023\n",

            "Computational study of microwave-driven drug delivery with realistic tumor modeling and optimized heating protocols for hepatocellular carcinoma. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most prevalent form of liver cancer, remains one of the top contributors to cancer-related mortality worldwide. Existing treatments like chemotherapy and thermal ablation face critical limitations, including suboptimal tumor coverage and high systemic toxicity. This study introduces a numerical approach to investigate the combined effects of pulsed microwave hyperthermia and thermosensitive liposomal (TSL) drug delivery. A 3D computational model was developed based on segmented CT imaging to replicate realistic liver tumor anatomy. The model simulates both spatial and temporal variations in drug diffusion, incorporating temperature and tissue damage-dependent parameters. Results indicate that pulsed hyperthermia enhances intracellular doxorubicin levels by 50.4 % (from 0.387 to 0.582 mol m−3) compared to traditional chemotherapy. Additionally, pulsed heating significantly reduces thermally ablated tumor volume (from 35.5 % to 18.6 %) relative to continuous heating. The use of anatomically accurate geometry allows for a more detailed analysis of how tumor and tissue shape irregularities influence therapeutic outcomes and temperature field diffusion. These results emphasize the potential for integrating targeted drug carriers and localized heating in advancing personalized treatment for liver cancer.. 2025\n",
            "Differential expression of AQP1 in microdomain-enriched membranes of renal cell carcinoma. Human aquaporin-1 (AQP1) is the most studied member of the aquaporin family, acting as molecular water channel. It is also considered a differentiation marker for proximal renal tubular cells, from which clear cells renal cell carcinoma (RCC) originates, playing an important role in urine formation. We therefore studied AQP1 expression at the proteomic level in RCC and normal tissues, mainly focusing on microdomain-enriched membranes in which AQP1 is highly concentrated. Subcellular fractions were prepared through differential centrifugation, and microdomain-enriched fractions were purified from a plasma membrane-enriched fraction by 1% Triton X-100 treatment followed by ultracentrifugation in sucrose gradient. After SDS-PAGE and Western blot analyses with antibodies against AQP1, lower expression levels of AQP1 isoforms were observed in each subcellular fraction of RCC compared to fractions from normal kidney tissues. The presence of AQP1 in the immunoreactive bands was verified by MALDI-TOF-MS and LC-ESI-MS/MS analysis. Glycosylation of AQP1 was also investigated using N-glycosidase F, confirming the presence of a N-glycosylated isoform of AQP1 in the 35-45-kDa region. These results highlight an under-expression of AQP1 protein and its glycosylated isoforms in homogenate and subcellular fraction obtained from RCC tissue compared to adjacent normal cortex. © 2007 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

            "Staring us in the face? An embodied theory of innate face preference. Human expertise in face perception grows over development, but even within minutes of birth, infants exhibit an extraordinary sensitivity to face-like stimuli. The dominant theory accounts for innate face detection by proposing that the neonate brain contains an innate face detection device, dubbed 'Conspec'. Newborn face preference has been promoted as some of the strongest evidence for innate knowledge, and forms a canonical stage for the modern form of the nature-nurture debate in psychology. Interpretation of newborn face preference results has concentrated on monocular stimulus properties, with little mention or focused investigation of potential binocular involvement. However, the question of whether and how newborns integrate the binocular visual streams bears directly on the generation of observable visual preferences. In this theoretical paper, we employ a synthetic approach utilizing robotic and computational models to draw together the threads of binocular integration and face preference in newborns, and demonstrate cases where the former may explain the latter. We suggest that a system-level view considering the binocular embodiment of newborn vision may offer a mutually satisfying resolution to some long-running arguments in the polarizing debate surrounding the existence and causal structure of newborns' 'innate knowledge' of faces. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.. 2014\n",

            "A novel photon detector made of silicon and carbon nanotubes. The use of silicon and the development of micro-technology made possible the transition from macro-to micro-detection systems and of very large-scale integration systems for microelectronics. The most powerful micro-detector recently developed is the Silicon PhotoMultiplier (SiPM) that allows a pixel dimension of microns in a hundred-pixel array. The use of nanotechnology opens now a new field of applications in which materials are \"built\" chemically up to the desired dimensions. This process allows the realization of complex structures that have finely pixelled sub-micron dimensions and that are cheap, light, and easy to produce. Between the materials suitable for nanotechnology, carbon nanotubes (CNT) play a main role because of their facility of being produced and their unique mechanical and electrical properties. They can be grown chemically in a very easy and cheap way, assembled in the desired geometry and directly connected to readout electronics devices. In addition, they can be coupled to silicon substrates to obtain mixed micro-nano structures with intermediate electronic properties. The first radiation detector using CNTs grown through a chemical vapour deposition (CVD) process has been realized using a sapphire substrate. This device, sensitive to the radiation in the range from 220 to more than 850 nm, exhibits a relevant increase in the photocurrent toward UV wavelengths both with continuous light and with pulsed radiation. This opens the door to the realization of a new kind of low-cost radiation detector with sub-micron spatial resolution and high sensitivity in the UV radiation region. In order to avoid the large dark current observed, a new detector has been realized using an p-doped silicon substrate. Electrical and optical properties of this novel detector have been intensively studied as well as the coupling between nanotubes and silicon. The strong matching found between the two different materials suggests the possibility of realizing a single photon detector with high quantum efficiency in the UV wavelength region. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Moreover, 27 out 28 specific proteins and their isoforms, present in spots excised from 2-DE gel of cortex or RCC cultures, corresponded to those identified on the 2-DE tissue cortex reference map, suggesting that these primary cultures retain the proteomic profile of the corresponding tissues. © 2005 American Chemical Society.. 2005\n",
            "Concepts in quantum state tomography and classical implementation with intense light: A tutorial. A tomographic measurement is a ubiquitous tool for estimating the properties of quantum states, and its application is known as quantum state tomography (QST). The process involves manipulating single photons in a sequence of projective measurements, often to construct a density matrix from which other information can be inferred, and is as laborious as it is complex. Here we unravel the steps of a QST and outline how it may be demonstrated in a fast and simple manner with intense (classical) light. We use scalar beams in a time reversal approach to simulate the outcome of a QST and exploit non-separability in classical vector beams as a means to treat the latter as a “classically entangled” state for illustrating QSTs directly.We provide a complete do-it-yourself resource for the practical implementation of this approach, complete with tutorial video, which we hope will facilitate the introduction of this core quantum tool into teaching and research laboratories alike.

This chapter reviews the current state of the art referring to the preparation and characterization of polymer composites containing different types of biochars derived from various raw materials. Biochar is a carbonaceous and renewable material derived from the thermochemical conversion of biomasses and/or post-consumer agricultural wastes in an oxygen-limited environment, well-fitting in the current circular economy concept. Some potential applications of the designed composite systems are discussed, highlighting the challenges and possible future developments. The use of biochar as carbon material with low environmental impact has been consolidated in several fields, from agriculture to water treatment.

Indeed, five zinc oxide (ZnO) micro- and nano-structures, i.e. Desert Roses (DRs), Multipods (MPs), Microwires (MWs), Nanoparticles (NPs) and Nanowires (NWs), were studied for the Rhodamine B (RhB) sonodegradation under ultrasonic irradiation. The DRs microparticles demonstrated the best sonocatalytic performance (100% degradation of RhB in 180 min) and the highest OH[rad] radicals generation under ultrasonic irradiation. Strikingly, the coupling of ultrasound and sun-light irradiation in a sonophotodegradation approach led to 100% degradation efficiency, i.e. color reduction, of RhB in just 10 min, revealing a great positive synergy between the photocatalytic and sonocatalytic mechanisms. The RhB sonophotocatalytic degradation was also evaluated at different initial dye concentrations and with the presence of anions in solution. It was demonstrated a good stability over repeated cycles of dye treatment, which probe the applicability of this technique with industrial effluents. In conclusion, sonophotocatalytic degradation synergizing sunlight and ultrasound in the presence of DRs microparticles shows a great potential and a starting point to investigate further the efficient treatment of organic dyes in wastewater.. 2019\n",

            "Spatial stimulus-response compatibility and coding of tactile motor events: influence of distance between stimulated and responding body parts, spatial complexity of the task and sex of subject. We studied spatial stimulus-response compatibility in the somatosensory modality by instructing 16 men and 16 women to press a key using the left or the right thumb in response to a nonnoxious electric stimulation delivered either to the left or to the right little finger or, in different blocks, to the left or to the right malleolar region. The task was performed in compatible (stimulus and key-response on the same side of the corporeal midline) and in incompatible conditions (stimulus and key-response on opposite sides of the corporeal midline). In Exp. 1 subjects were tested while keeping their limbs in anatomic position; in Exp. 2 subjects performed the task while keeping the left upper and lower limbs on the right side and the right limbs on the left side of the bodily midline (crossed position). The compatibility effect was observed in both experiments and was higher for stimuli delivered to the little finger than to the malleolar region. This suggests that the cost of inhibiting compatible responses is maximal when stimulated and responding body parts are contiguous. Moreover, in the spatially most demanding task (Exp. 2) men outperformed women for both speed and accuracy suggesting a sex-related specialisation in the spatial processing of somatosensory information.. 2000\n",

            "A novel computerized surgeon-machine interface for robot-assisted laser phonomicrosurgery. Objectives/Hypothesis To introduce a novel computerized surgical system for improved usability, intuitiveness, accuracy, and controllability in robot-assisted laser phonomicrosurgery. Study Design Pilot technology assessment. Methods The novel system was developed involving a newly designed motorized laser micromanipulator, a touch-screen display, and a graphics stylus. The system allows the control of a CO2 laser through interaction between the stylus and the live video of the surgical area. This empowers the stylus with the ability to have actual effect on the surgical site. Surgical enhancements afforded by this system were established through a pilot technology assessment using randomized trials comparing its performance with a state-of-the-art laser microsurgery system. Resident surgeons and medical students were chosen as subjects in performing sets of trajectory-following exercises. Image processing-based techniques were used for an objective performance assessment. A System Usability Scale-based questionnaire was used for the qualitative assessment. Results The computerized interface demonstrated superiority in usability, accuracy, and controllability over the state-of-the-art system. Significant ease of use and learning experienced by the subjects were demonstrated by the usability score assigned to the two compared interfaces: computerized interface=83.96% versus state-of-the-art=68.02%. The objective analysis showed a significant enhancement in accuracy and controllability: computerized interface=90.02% versus state-of-the-art=75.59%. Conclusions The novel system significantly enhances the accuracy, usability, and controllability in laser phonomicrosurgery.

            "Development and characterisation of aluminium matrix nanocomposites ALSi10Mg/MgAl2O4 by laser powder bed fusion. Recently, additive manufacturing techniques have been gaining attention for the fabrication of parts from aluminium alloys to composites. In this work, the processing of an AlSi10Mg based composite reinforced with 0.5% in weight of MgAl2O4 nanoparticles through laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) process is presented. After an initial investigation about the effect of process parameters on the densification levels, the LPBF materials were analysed in terms of microstructure, thermo-mechanical and mechanical properties. The presence of MgAl2O4 nanoparticles involves an increment of the volumetric energy density delivered to the materials, in order to fabricate samples with high densification levels similar to the AlSi10Mg samples. However, the application of different building parameters results in modifying the size of the cellular structures influencing the mechanical properties and therefore, limiting the strengthening effect of the reinforcement.. 2018\n",
            "Bio-oil from pyrolysis of wood pellets using a microwave multimode oven and different microwave absorbers. Wood pellets were pyrolyzed using a microwave oven and different microwave power, apparatus set-up and microwave absorbers (none, Fe, and carbon). Pyrolysis was realized in a short time in the presence of Fe or carbon while it was incomplete if the absorber was not present. Furthermore when the absorber was present the shape of the pellets remained unaltered while if the absorber was not employed pellets were disaggregated. Three fractions were collected from each pyrolysis: a gas, a liquid also called bio-oil and a solid called bio-char. The bio-oil contained two phases and they were quantitatively characterized through a GC/MS-FID procedure using an internal standard according to a previously reported method. HPLC/MS, FTIR and1H NMR spectroscopy were also employed for characterization of these liquids. Cellulose pyrolysis products were present in the upper phase such as water, acetic acid, furans (such as furfural), carbohydrates and their derivatives. Compounds from pyrolysis of lignin such as phenols and veratric acid were present in the bottom phase. The microwave assisted pyrolysis showed the possibility to efficiently convert wood pellets in different products. The main economical important components may be separated and used as chemicals, natural drugs or pesticides, while the remaining components, the solid and the gas may be used for energy production (solid and bio-oil). Solid may be also used for carbon sequestration.. 2015\n",

In this work, we discuss on the physical properties of hydrogenated amorphous silicon carbide (a-Si 1-x C x :H) thin films deposited by plasma enhanced CVD by using SiH 4 + CH 4 and SiH 4 + C 2 H 2 gas mixtures under several deposition conditions. We can argue a complete chemical order in the samples deposited by SiH 4 + CH 4 for x > 0.4, while for those grown by SiH 4 + C 2 H 2 , such order is preserved for lower C content. With regards to the radiative properties, for all the under-stoichiometric samples the photoluminescence (PL) Stokes shifts result to be strictly correlated to the absorption properties within the static disorder model. For C-rich materials, the electronic density of states becomes much more complex than in Si-rich ones because of the possibility of sp 2 and sp 3 configurations for C bonds, so that the presence of localized tail states cannot explain anymore the PL properties. © 2001 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.. 2001\n",

            "Pyrolysis of α-cellulose using a multimode microwave oven. α-Cellulose was pyrolyzed using a multimode microwave oven, different microwave absorbers and experimental set ups. The microwave absorber showed a strong influence: carbon gave a large gasification of cellulose (yield of gas up to 53.8%) while Al2O3 gave a high yield of bio-char (64.1%) and a low gas production (3.0%). Bio-oil was obtained with the highest yield (37.6%) using iron as microwave absorber and a condenser between the oven and the collecting system. Dark brown bio-oils having low density and viscosity due to the presence of large amount of furanosidic compounds were collected. Bio-oils were characterized through GC–MS, FT-IR, NMR, The GC–MS analysis was employed to evaluate the composition of bio-oils using calculated retention factors. A high concentration of levoglucosan (133.9 mg/mL) together with acetic acid, acetic anhydride, 1-hydroxy-2-propanone, formic acid and furfural were obtained using graphite as microwave absorber. A mechanisms was proposed to rationalize the formation of aromatic compounds present in bio-oils. Water contents in bio-oils were affected by all parameters of the process, mainly by the microwave absorber. The use of silica has proved to be a promising way to obtain bio-oil with low water content (13%), while pyrolysis in the presence of carbon gave a large amount of water (46%).. 2016\n",

            "Graphene and lithium-based battery electrodes: A review of recent literature. Graphene is a new generation material, which finds potential and practical applications in a vast range of research areas. It has unrivalled characteristics, chiefly in terms of electronic conductivity, mechanical robustness and large surface area, which allow the attainment of outstanding performances in the material science field. Some unneglectable issues, such as the high cost of production at high quality and corresponding scarce availability in large amounts necessary for mass scale distribution, slow down graphene widespread utilization; however, in the last decade both basic academic and applied industrial materials research have achieved remarkable breakthroughs thanks to the implementation of graphene and related 1D derivatives. In this work, after briefly recalling the main characteristics of graphene, we present an extensive overview of the most recent advances in the development of the Li-ion battery anodes granted by the use of neat and engineered graphene and related 1D materials. Being far from totally exhaustive, due to the immense scientific production in the field yearly, we chiefly focus here on the role of graphene in materials modification for performance enhancement in both half and full lithium-based cells and give some insights on related promising perspectives.. 2020\n",
            "A local interaction simulation approach to the analysis of thin-film growth. Several models have been developed for studying growth patterns and the formation of rough surfaces and interfaces. An analytical treatment of these models, leading to a prediction of the time evolution of the system, is, however, usually inadequate to describe the properties of the bulk of the deposited film. As a consequence, numerical simulations become the only viable alternative. In this contribution we present a preliminary model, based on the local interaction simulation approach, for the description of thin semiconducting films growth. The proposed approach allows us to include in the model all kinds of local mechanisms and/or non-trivial boundary conditions. A few numerical results are presented, showing good qualitative agreement with experimental data. Reliable simulations with a very good resolution may be performed in a reasonable central processing unit time, if parallel processing is adopted. © 2000 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.. 2000\n",

            "A Half-Sandwich Os(II) Glucoconjugated NHC Complex as a Modulator of Amyloid Aggregation. Herein, the effects of a novel half-sandwich Os(II) complex on the aggregation of an amyloid model system, derived from the C-terminal domain of the nucleophosmin 1 protein (NPM1264-277), were investigated. The thioflavin T (ThT) binding assay revealed that the complex [(η6-toluene)Os(NHCglu)Cl2] (where NHCglu is the N-heterocyclic carbene ligand 1-methyl-3-{2,3,4,6-tetra-O-acetyl-1-glucosyl}imidazol-2-ylidene), hence named Os-Tolu, was able to repress amyloid aggregation in a dose-dependent way. Conformational studies through circular dichroism (CD) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopies clearly indicated that this inhibitory effect occurred through the stabilization of α-helical structures of monomeric NPM1264-277, thus hampering self-recognition. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) studies evidenced, through the formation of coordination adducts, direct interactions of the amyloid peptide with the Os-glucoconjugate complex that, in turn, promote chemical modifications of the sequence further disfavoring the self-assembly process. Noticeably, the presence of Os-Tolu completely repressed the formation of amyloid fibers in scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis and induced a slight rescue of cell viability, in contrast to its reduction caused by the amyloid model in human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. These data strongly support the hypothesis of expanding the use of osmium-based agents to neurodegenerative diseases, positioning them as potential neurodrugs.. 2025\n",

            "Luminescent solar concentrators: Nanorods and raytrace modeling. Nanorods are a novel and promising component for luminescent solar concentrators (LSCs). In particular, their spectra suggest reduced re-absorption losses. We report the incorporation of core-shell nanorods in homogeneous and thin film LSCs. The rods in the solid host appear to retain their spectral features compared to their dissolved state. Short-circuit current measurements with a calibrated solar cell have been compared with the computational simulation of the LSCs. Our raytrace model was applied to fit the fundamental emission spectrum and extract the quantum efficiency (QE) of the nanorods in the concentrators. In the case of the homogeneous LSC, the extracted QE was (67±4)%, which is in good agreement with the quoted value of about 70% for rods in solution. The thin film samples showed noticeably worse performance, which was attributed to possible agglomeration of rods and to macroscopic defects in the film. Finally, the raytrace model was applied to compare the self-absorption between a typical quantum dot concentrator and a nanorod concentrator. The result supported the argument that nanorods exhibit a smaller spectral overlap and consequently less re-absorption losses. © 2008 IEEE.. 2008\n",

Carbon Dots (CDs) have recently attracted a considerable amount of attention thanks to their well-documented biocompatibility, tunable photoluminescence, and excellent water solubility. However, CDs need further analysis before their potential use in clinical trials. Previously, we reported a new type of carbon nitride dot (CND) that displayed selective cancer uptake traits attributed to structural resemblances between CNDs and glutamine. Here, the effects of surface structural differences on the cellular uptake of CNDs are further investigated to understand their selective cancer cell uptake trend. Beyond enhanced drug loading on modified CNDs, our cytotoxicity, western blotting and bioimaging studies proposed that modified CNDs’ cellular uptake mechanism is thoroughly linked with ASCT2 and LAT1 transporters. Therefore, CNDs have a promising trait of selective cancer cell targeting by utilizing highly expressed transporters on cancer cells.

            "Co-Adsorbent Effect on the Sensitization of TiO2 and ZnO Surfaces: A Theoretical Study. Co-adsorbents are often employed in DSSC to avoid electron/hole recombination at the hybrid organic/inorganic interface. Here we investigate, by means of density functional theory simulations, the changes induced in the structural and electronic properties of a hybrid heterostructure by the presence of a co-adsorbent. In particular, we focus on a prototype interface obtained by co-grafting a dye molecule (the hemi-squaraine dye) and imidazole at the oxide surfaces mostly employed in DSSC (anatase-TiO2(101) and ZnO(1100)). Our results show that beside avoiding dye aggregation, the co-adsorbent plays an active role in stabilizing the binding between the chromophore and oxide substrate and in tuning the optoelectronic properties of the system. We found that imidazole shifts downward the dye energy levels (HOMO and LUMO) while raising the oxide valence and conduction bands, strongly influencing the energy alignment of the interface. As such, a co-adsorbent can either modify the type of heterostructure (straddling, staggered, or broken gap) or change the open circuit voltage (Voc), with potentially both beneficial or detrimental effect of the final device performance.. 2015\n",

Biocomposites are increasingly used in the industry for the replacement of synthetic materials, thanks to their good mechanical properties, being lightweight, and having low cost. Unfortunately, in several potential fields of structural application their static strength and fatigue life are not high enough. For this reason, several chemical treatments on the fibers have been proposed in literature, although still without fully satisfactory results. To overcome this drawback, in this study we present a procedure based on the addition of a carbonaceous filler to a green epoxy matrix reinforced by Agave sisalana fibers. Among all carbon-based materials, biochar was selected for its environmental friendliness, along with its ability to improve the mechanical properties of polymers. Different percentages of biochar, 1, 2, and 4 wt %, were finely dispersed into the resin using a mixer and a sonicator, then a compression molding process coupled with an optimized thermomechanical cure process was used to produce a short fiber biocomposite with Vf = 35%. Systematic experimental tests have shown that the presence of biochar, in the amount 2 wt %, has significant effects on the matrix and fiber interphase, and leads to an increase of up to three orders of magnitude in the fatigue life, together with an appreciable improvement in static tensile strength.. 2021\n",

The assignment is done via the systematic parallel SEM and XRD investigation of the samples. Data are also discussed in comparison with PL spectra of PQ reported in the literature. The blue shift of the bulk phase PL spectrum is assigned to its smaller (about 9 less than in the thin film phase) molecular packing density in the ab-plane, and accordingly, to a decreased π-π orbital overlap. © 2012 American Institute of Physics.. 2012\n",

The device allows to reconstruct the target characteristics taking advantage of the backscattered light. The motion of the sensor is obtained by means of a robot manipulator which gripper grasps and moves the sensor. The realized device has been tested in order to evaluate its ability to provide useful information on colours, surface opacity and profile of the detected objects. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

            "Towards Open Zero-Shot Learning. In Generalized Zero-Shot Learning (GZSL), unseen categories (for which no visual data are available at training time) can be predicted by leveraging their class embeddings (e.g., a list of attributes describing them) together with a complementary pool of seen classes (paired with both visual data and class embeddings). Despite GZSL is arguably challenging, we posit that knowing in advance the class embeddings, especially for unseen categories, is an actual limit of the applicability of GZSL towards real-world scenarios. To relax this assumption, we propose Open Zero-Shot Learning (OZSL) as the problem of recognizing seen and unseen classes (as in GZSL) while also rejecting instances from unknown categories, for which neither visual data nor class embeddings are provided. We formalize the OZSL problem introducing evaluation protocols, error metrics and benchmark datasets. We also tackle the OZSL problem by proposing and evaluating the idea of performing unknown feature generation.. 2022\n",
            "Compositional and structural analysis of hydrogenated amorphous silicon—nitrogen alloys prepared by plasma-enhanced chemical vapour deposition. Amorphous hydrogenated silicon-nitrogen alloys (a-Si1−xNx: H), having energy gaps in the range 2·0–5·2 eV, have been deposited in ultra-high vacuum by 13·56Mhz plasma-enhanced chemical vapour deposition from SiH4+NH3 gas mixtures with Nha percentages in the range 6·2–97·3%. The compositions of the films were obtained by Rutherford back-scattering spectroscopy and elastic recoil detection analysis and the structure and the bonding configurations studied by infrared and Raman spectroscopies. Films having a nitrogen content x in the range 0·07–0·63 and a hydrogen content as high as 38at.% have been obtained. For x < 0·5, the hydrogen is mainly bonded to silicon and nitrogen is prevalently incorporated in the Nsis configuration. For x > 0·5, NHn bonds become predominant, which allows the growth of stoichiometric and over-stoichiometric films. © 1996 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.. 1996\n",
            "Effects of power density and molecule dwell time on compositional and optoelectronic properties of a-SiC : H alloys. In this paper we report a careful analysis of how the composition of a-SIC : H films with optical gap from 2.1 to 2.6eV deposited by PECVD in SiH4 + CH4 gas mixtures are affected by variations of the molecule dwell time and of the effective dissipated power. We show that variations in the effective dissipated power (from 1.69 to 4.53 W) and in the dwell time (from 0.067 to 1s) do not change the optoelectronic properties, whose dependence on the optical gap is typical of high electronic quality films deposited in the lower power regime and, also, that these variations lead only to different carbon incorporations in the growing films, without affecting the growth mechanism and the film structure.. 1996\n",
            "Multi-objective modeling of ground deformation and gravity changes of volcanic eruptions. Inverse modeling of geophysical observations is becoming an important topic in volcanology. The advantage of exploiting innovative inverse methods in volcanology is twofold by providing: a robust tool for the interpretation of the observations and a quantitative model-based assessment of volcanic hazard. This paper re-interprets the data collected during the 1981 eruption of Mt Etna, which offers a good case study to explore and validate new inversion algorithms. Single-objective optimization and multi-objective optimization are here applied in order to improve the fitting of the geophysical observations and better constrain the model parameters. We explore the genetic algorithm NSGA2 and the differential evolution (DE) method. The inverse results provide a better fitting of the model to the geophysical observations with respect to previously published results. In particular, NSGA2 shows low fitting error in electro-optical distance measurements (EDM), leveling and micro-gravity measurements; while the DE algorithm provides a set of solutions that combine low leveling error with low EDM error but that are characterized by a poor capability of minimizing all measures at the same time. The sensitivity of the model to variations of its parameters are investigated by means of the Morris technique and the Sobol’ indices with the aim of identifying the parameters that have higher impact on the model. In particular, the model parameters, which define the sources position, their dip and the porosity of the infiltration zones, are found to be the more sensitive. In addition, being the robustness a good indicator of the quality of a solution, a subset of solutions with good characteristics is selected and their robustness is evaluated in order to identify the more suitable model.. 2015\n",

            "Analytical Model and Experimental Testing of the SoftFoot: An Adaptive Robot Foot for Walking Over Obstacles and Irregular Terrains. Robot feet are crucial for maintaining dynamic stability and propelling the body during walking, especially on uneven terrains. Traditionally, robot feet were mostly designed as flat and stiff pieces of metal, which meets its limitations when the robot is required to step on irregular grounds, e.g. stones. While one could think that adding compliance under such feet would solve the problem, this is not the case. To address this problem, we introduced the SoftFoot, an adaptive foot design that can enhance walking performance over irregular grounds. The proposed design is completely passive and varies its shape and stiffness based on the exerted forces, through a system of pulley, tendons, and springs opportunely placed in the structure. This paper outlines the motivation behind the SoftFoot and describes the theoretical model which led to its final design. The proposed system has been experimentally tested and compared with two analogous conventional feet, a rigid one and a compliant one, with similar footprints and soles. The experimental validation focuses on the analysis of the standing performance, measured in terms of the equivalent support surface extension and the compensatory ankle angle, and the rejection of impulsive forces, which is important in events such as stepping on unforeseen obstacles. Results show that the SoftFoot has the largest equivalent support surface when standing on obstacles, and absorbs impulsive loads in a way almost as good as a compliant foot.. 2024\n",

            "Rhes regulates dopamine D2 receptor transmission in striatal cholinergic interneurons. Ras homolog enriched in striatum (Rhes) is highly expressed in striatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs) of rodents. In the present study, we characterized the expression of Rhes mRNA across species, as well as its functional role in other striatal neuron subtypes. Double in situ hybridization analysis showed that Rhes transcript is selectively localized in striatal cholinergic interneurons (ChIs), but not in GABAergic parvalbumin- or in neuropeptide Y-positive cell populations. Rhes is closely linked to dopamine-dependent signaling. Therefore, we recorded ChIs activity in basal condition and following dopamine receptor activation. Surprisingly, instead of an expected dopamine D2 receptor (D2R)-mediated inhibition, we observed an aberrant excitatory response in ChIs from Rhes knockout mice. Conversely, the effect of D1R agonist on ChIs was less robust in Rhes mutants than in controls. Although Rhes deletion in mutants occurs throughout the striatum, we demonstrate that the D2R response is altered specifically in ChIs, since it was recorded in pharmacological isolation, and prevented either by intrapipette BAPTA or by GDP-β-S. Moreover, we show that blockade of Cav2.2 calcium channels prevented the abnormal D2R response. Finally, we found that the abnormal D2R activation in ChIs was rescued by selective PI3K inhibition thus suggesting that Rhes functionally modulates PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in these neurons. Our findings reveal that, besides its expression in MSNs, Rhes is localized also in striatal ChIs and, most importantly, lack of this G-protein, significantly alters D2R modulation of striatal cholinergic excitability.. 2015\n",
            "Use of phosphosynapsin I-specific antibodies for image analysis of signal transduction in single nerve terminals. We have developed a semi-quantitative method for indirectly revealing variations in the concentration of second messengers (Ca2+, cyclic AMP) in single presynaptic boutons by detecting the phosphorylation of the synapsins, excellent nerve terminal substrates for cyclic AMP- and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases. For this purpose, we employed polyclonal, antipeptide antibodies recognising exclusively synapsin I phosphorylated by Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (at site 3) or synapsins I/II phosphorylated by either cAMP-dependent protein kinase or Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase I (at site 1). Cerebellar granular neurones in culture were double-labelled with a monoclonal antibody to synapsins I/II and either of the polyclonal antibodies. Digitised images were analysed to determine the relative phosphorylation stoichiometry at each individual nerve terminal. We have found that: (i) under basal conditions, phosphorylation of site 3 was undetectable, whereas site 1 exhibited some degree of constitutive phosphorylation; (ii) depolarisation in the presence of extracellular Ca2+ was followed by a selective and widespread increase in site 3 phosphorylation, although the relative phosphorylation stoichiometry varied among individual terminals; and (iii) phosphorylation of site 1 was increased by stimulation of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase but not by depolarisation and often occurred in specific nerve terminal sub-populations aligned along axon branches. In addition to shedding light on the regulation of synapsin phosphorylation in living nerve terminals, this approach permits the spatially-resolved analysis of the activation of signal transduction pathways in the presynaptic compartment, which is usually too small to be studied with other currently available techniques.. 2000\n",

            "Brightness degradation controlled by current induced metastable defect creation in a-SiC:H based light emitting diodes. A study of the electroluminescence degradation of a-SiC:H based light emitting devices (LED) is presented for the first time. The best initial peak brightness obtained is 4.2 cd/m2. All LEDs reported in this paper emit a red light which, when operated under continuous bias in a not fully darkened room, is visible for several minutes, depending on degradation rate. The time dependence of LED degradation, which is reversible upon annealing, can be explained if self-annealing is taken into account. There is evidence of an improved LED performance for lower temperature operation. Pulsed operation, with respect to dc operation, produces a markedly lower defect production rate, associated to a higher brightness after degradation. The possibility of some optimization of the operation parameters (peak current, duty cycle) is discussed.. 1995\n",

In this work, we have investigated the potential benefits of combining biodegradable pH sensitive core-shell PCL NPs loaded with IM and enzyme sensitive polyelectrolyte complexes (PECs) loaded with doxorubicin (DOX). Our in vitro studies confirmed the excellent antileukemic activity of dual drug loaded nanoparticles on CML cells. As compared with a drug alone, co-treatment with IM and DOX loaded in nanoparticles allowed a sustained downregulation of BCR-ABL and significant CML stem cell death. This furthermore showed that couple formulation of nanoparticles enhanced the drugs' kinetics and efficacy, combined with the pH sensibility of core-shell PCL NPs loaded with IM and enzyme sensitive polyelectrolyte complexes (PECs) loaded with DOX.

The great usefulness of remote recording of biomedical signals in most aspects of daily life has generated an increasing interest in this field.

            "Polylactic- Glycolic Acid Microparticles–Encapsulated Prostaglandin E1 as A Novel Strategy In Triple Negative Breast Cancer. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is characterized by unique clinical and pathological traits, from which its aggressive nature and the absence of specific treatments are the most worrying. Prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) can affect the morphology of human breast tumor cell lines, but its potential therapeutic effects appear to be counteracted by its high degradability in physiological environments. For this reason, polylactic-glycolic acid polymeric microparticles (MPs) are developed to stabilize PGE1 in damp conditions and enable sustained local release for the treatment of TNBC after surgical removal of the tumor mass. Specifically, the PGE1 embedded MPs are produced using a double emulsion solvent-evaporation method, then analyzed through Mastersizer and scanning electron microscopy. Afterward, the encapsulation efficiency and the PGE1 release are examined using liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry, and their stability at various storage temperatures is assessed. Finally, the carrier toxicity is evaluated in TNBC cells and colon adenocarcinoma epithelial cells, Caco-2. A reliable action on carcinogenic cells specific to breast cancer is observed. Although in vivo studies are still needed, these results open the way to using such a carrier for the intralesional delivery of PGE1 and its use against TNBC.. 2025\n",
            "First-principles study of crystalline and amorphous Ge2Sb2Te5 and the effects of stoichiometric defects. Based on ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, we investigated the structural, electronic and vibrational properties of cubic and amorphous Ge2Sb2Te5 (GST) phase change material, focusing in particular on the effects of defects in stoichiometry on the electronic properties. It turned out Ge/Sb deficiencies (excess) in the cubic phase induce a shift of the Fermi level inside the valence (conduction) bands. In contrast, the amorphous network is flexible enough to accommodate defects in stoichiometry, keeping the Fermi level pinned at the center of the bandgap (at zero temperature).

            "Optical conductivity renormalization of graphene on SrTiO3 due to resonant excitonic effects mediated by Ti 3d orbitals. We present evidence of a drastic renormalization of the optical conductivity of graphene on SrTiO3 resulting in almost full transparency in the ultraviolet region. These findings are attributed to resonant excitonic effects further supported by ab initio Bethe-Salpeter equation and density functional theory calculations. The (π,π∗) orbitals of graphene and Ti-3d t2g orbitals of SrTiO3 are strongly hybridized and the interactions of electron-hole states residing in those orbitals play dominant role in the graphene optical conductivity. These interactions are present much below the optical band gap of bulk SrTiO3.

            "Skin transport of PEGylated poly(ε-caprolactone) nanoparticles assisted by (2-hydroxypropyl)-β-cyclodextrin. The aim of this work was to investigate the potential of small nanoparticles (NPs) made of a poly(ethylene glycol)-poly(ε-caprolactone)-amphiphilic diblock copolymer (PEG-. b-PCL, PEG. =. 2. kDa and PCL. =. 4.2. kDa) as drug carrier system through the skin. Zinc(II) phthalocyanine (ZnPc), selected as lipophilic and fluorescent model molecule, was loaded inside NPs by a melting/sonication procedure. Loaded NPs with a hydrodynamic diameter around 60. nm, a slightly negative zeta potential and a ZnPc entrapment dependent on polymer/ZnPc ratio were obtained. Spectroscopic investigations evidenced that ZnPc was entrapped in monomeric form maintaining its emission properties. The transport of ZnPc through porcine ear skin was evaluated on Franz-type diffusion cells after treatment with different vehicles (water or PEG 0.4. kDa) containing free ZnPc or ZnPc-loaded NPs without and with (2-hydroxypropyl)-β-cyclodextrin (HPβCD) as permeation enhancer. Independently of the sample tested, ZnPc was transported in the skin without reaching receptor compartment. On the other hand, ZnPc was found in the skin in large amount and also in the viable epidermis when delivered through NPs associated with HPβCD, especially in conditions limiting water evaporation. Fluorescence images of skin samples after 24. h of permeation were in line with ZnPc dosage in the skin and demonstrated the ability of NPs covalently tagged with rhodamine to penetrate the skin and to locate in the intercellular spaces. Insight into skin chemical properties upon application of NPs by confocal Raman spectroscopy demonstrated that HPβCD caused an alteration of water profile in the skin, highly reducing the degree of hydration at stratum corneum/viable epidermis interface which can promote NP transport. Taken together, these results highlight PEG-. b-PCL NPs coupled with HPβCD as a novel vehicle for the skin delivery of highly lipophilic compounds paving the way to several applications.. 2015\n",

            "Online-Learnt and Deployed MoDem System. The telecommunications industry has seen a significant increase in the demand for high-quality transmission and processing of digital information. As a result, research efforts have been focused on developing high-performance systems for the modulation and demodulation of digital information signals. These efforts have led to exploring artificial intelligence (AI) techniques for implementing demodulation. However, traditional AI-based demodulation techniques use specific data for supervised training, which results in models that hardly adapt to changing environments. These models do not consider the time variance that can affect a realistic communication chain, where physical devices and their functionalities inevitably influence the signal. Moreover, the non-idealities that characterize the communication channel are subject to unpredictable and random temporal fluctuations. To address these issues, this manuscript proposes a novel system that implements modulation and demodulation of digital signals and can adapt the demodulation to the characteristics of the specific front-end adopted, as well as to those of the communication channel, during execution on the field. The proposed system estimates the main parameters that characterize the received signal and performs neural demodulation at the receiver. This is achieved through an online learning process that takes place at the transmitter and is sent to the receiver in real-time. This approach allows the system to adapt to the statistically varying conditions of ongoing communication, resulting in improved performance and reliability.. 2023\n",
            "Artificial intelligence pathway search to resolve catalytic glycerol hydrogenolysis selectivity. The complex interaction between molecules and catalyst surfaces leads to great difficulties in understanding and predicting the activity and selectivity in heterogeneous catalysis. Here we develop an end-to-end artificial intelligence framework for the activity prediction of heterogeneous catalytic systems (AI-Cat method), which takes simple inputs from names of molecules and metal catalysts and outputs the reaction energy profile from the input molecule to low energy pathway products. The AI-Cat method combines two neural network models, one for predicting reaction patterns and the other for providing the reaction barrier and energy, with a Monte Carlo tree search to resolve the low energy pathways in a reaction network. We then apply AI-Cat to resolve the reaction network of glycerol hydrogenolysis on Cu surfaces, which is a typical selective C-O bond activation system and of key significance for biomass-derived polyol utilization. We show that glycerol hydrogenolysis features a huge reaction network of relevant candidates, containing 420 reaction intermediates and 2467 elementary reactions. Among them, the surface-mediated enol-keto tautomeric resonance is a key step to facilitate the primary C-OH bond breaking and thus selects 1,2-propanediol as the major product on Cu catalysts. 1,3-Propanediol can only be produced under strong acidic conditions and high surface H coverage by following a hydrogenation-dehydration pathway. AI-Cat further discovers six low-energy reaction patterns for C-O bond activation on metals that is of general significance to polyol catalysis. Our results demonstrate that the reaction prediction for complex heterogeneous catalysis is now feasible with AI-based atomic simulation and a Monte Carlo tree search.. 2022\n",

Elongated akaganéite (β-FeOOH) nanostructures were synthesized through a simple hydrothermal route, in which a careful selection of the experimental conditions allows for a tunable length and aspect ratio and concomitantly predetermines the magnetic response. An in-depth structural characterization using transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and Raman spectroscopy, jointly with DC magnetic measurements, reveals a complex scenario where the interstitial Cl-content dictates the β-FeOOH thermal stability and leads to the formation of bulk uncompensated spins along the inner channels. The coexistence of different magnetic contributions is observed to result in a non-monotonic dependence of the coercivity and exchange bias field on both temperature and size, posing major limitations for the archetypical magnetic core-shell model generally assumed for nanostructured antiferromagnets. As a proof of concept, we further show how the β-FeOOH internal microstructure can be chemically manipulated through Cl-anion exchange, giving rise to a superparamagnetic component that comes along with an almost 20-fold increase in the coercivity at low temperature. The evaluation of these results reveals the potential of controlling the interplay between the crystal and magnetic structure via intercalation chemistry in antiferromagnets, expanding fundamental science knowledge and supporting practical applications, given their huge role in the technological fields of spintronics and magnonics.. 2022\n",

Novel robotic applications, such as service robots, support the interaction between a human and a robot within the same workspace.

            "An Autoencoder-Based Deep-Learning Method for Augmenting the Sensing Capability of Piezoelectric Microelectromechanical System Sensors in a Fluid-Dynamic System. Herein, an innovative deep-learning architecture is proposed to enhance the sensing capabilities of a microelectromechanical system (MEMS) used in fluid dynamic applications. The MEMS sensor comprises a polyvinylidene fluoride flexible (PVDF) piezoelectric flag and a bluff body, with vortex generation influenced not only by the bluff body's geometry but also by the input fluid speed. As a result, mechanical vibrations are induced in the piezoelectric flag, leading to charge displacement and the generation of electrical voltage signals. Through the developed deep learning method, accurate extraction of wind speed and successful classification of turbulence are achieved. Experimental tests in a wind tunnel, involving various wind speeds and bluff body geometries, demonstrate the robust correlation between the extracted continuous manifold in Fourier spectra and wind speed. By incorporating a feed-forward network alongside the autoencoder, wind speed information even under strong turbulence is extracted. Moreover, the deep learning method's ability to classify different bluff bodies, independent of wind speed, is investigated. The findings reveal a unique capability to fingerprint turbulence and distinguish them for various applications.

            "Human–robot collaboration in industrial environments: A literature review on non-destructive disassembly. Nowadays, numerous companies and industries introduce recycling processes in their production, aiming to increase the sustainable use of the planet's natural resources. Nevertheless, these processes remain inefficient due to the high degree of complexity and variation in the products. In order to remedy this, industry stakeholders adopt the circular economy business model and introduce take-back programmes and remanufacturing processes for their End of Life products in their own supply chains. Take-back programmes enable the re-sourcing of sub-assemblies and components of previously manufactured products while remanufacturing processes encourage non-destructive disassembly. Due to the uncertain conditions of the re-sourced products, fully automated cells cannot cope with the demanding disassembly processes. Therefore, there is a need to establish hybrid disassembly robot cells where humans and robots work closely together in a process known as human–robot collaborative disassembly (HRCD). This paper examines the landscape of HRCD and reviews the progress in the field during the period 2009–2020. The analysis investigates principles and elements of human–robot collaboration in industrial environments such as safety standards and collaborative operation modes, HRI communication interfaces, and the design characteristics of a disassembly process. Additionally, the various technical challenges of HRCD are explored, and a review of existing systems supporting HRCD is presented.

Here we introduce the LASP code, which is designed for large-scale atomistic simulation of complex materials with neural network (NN) potential. The software architecture and functionalities of LASP will be overviewed. LASP features with the global neural network (G-NN) potential that is generated by learning the first principles dataset of global PES from stochastic surface walking (SSW) global optimization. The combination of the SSW method with global NN potential facilitates greatly the PES exploration for a wide range of complex materials. Not limited to SSW-NN global optimization, the software implements standard interfaces to dock with other energy/force evaluation packages and can also perform common tasks for computing PES properties, such as single-ended and double-ended transition state search, the molecular dynamics simulation with and without restraints. A few examples are given to illustrate the efficiency and capabilities of LASP code. Our ongoing efforts for code developing and G-NN potential library building are also presented.

            "Highly efficient planar perovskite solar cells through band alignment engineering. The simplification of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), by replacing the mesoporous electron selective layer (ESL) with a planar one, is advantageous for large-scale manufacturing. PSCs with a planar TiO2 ESL have been demonstrated, but these exhibit unstabilized power conversion efficiencies (PCEs). Herein we show that planar PSCs using TiO2 are inherently limited due to conduction band misalignment and demonstrate, with a variety of characterization techniques, for the first time that SnO2 achieves a barrier-free energetic configuration, obtaining almost hysteresis-free PCEs of over 18% with record high voltages of up to 1.19 V.. 2015\n",
            "Localized detection of ions and biomolecules with a force-controlled scanning nanopore microscope. Proteins, nucleic acids and ions secreted from single cells are the key signalling factors that determine the interaction of cells with their environment and the neighbouring cells. It is possible to study individual ion channels by pipette clamping, but it is difficult to dynamically monitor the activity of ion channels and transporters across the cellular membrane. Here we show that a solid-state nanopore integrated in an atomic force microscope can be used for the stochastic sensing of secreted molecules and the activity of ion channels in arbitrary locations both inside and outside a cell. The translocation of biomolecules and ions through the nanopore is observed in real time in live cells. The versatile nature of this approach allows us to detect specific biomolecules under controlled mechanical confinement and to monitor the ion-channel activities of single cells. Moreover, the nanopore microscope was used to image the surface of the nuclear membrane via high-resolution scanning ion conductance measurements.. 2019\n",

            "Atomic structure of boron resolved using machine learning and global sampling. Boron crystals, despite their simple composition, must rank top for complexity: even the atomic structure of the ground state of β-B remains uncertain after 60 years' study. This makes it difficult to understand the many exotic photoelectric properties of boron. The presence of self-doping atoms in the crystal interstitial sites forms an astronomical configurational space, making the determination of the real configuration virtually impossible using current techniques. Here, by combining machine learning with the latest stochastic surface walking (SSW) global optimization, we explore for the first time the potential energy surface of β-B, revealing 15293 distinct configurations out of the 2 × 105 minima visited, and reveal the key rules governing the filling of the interstitial sites. This advance is only allowed by the construction of an accurate and efficient neural network (NN) potential using a new series of structural descriptors that can sensitively discriminate the complex boron bonding environment. We show that, in contrast to the conventional views on the numerous energy-degenerate configurations, only 40 minima of β-B are identified to be within 7 meV per atom in energy above the global minimum of β-B, most of them having been discovered for the first time. These low energy structures are classified into three types of skeletons and six patterns of doping configurations, with a clear preference for a few characteristic interstitial sites. The observed β-B and its properties are influenced strongly by a particular doping site, the B19 site that neighbors the B18 site, which has an exceptionally large vibrational entropy. The configuration with this B19 occupancy, which ranks only 15th at 0 K, turns out to be dominant at high temperatures. Our results highlight the novel SSW-NN architecture as the leading problem solver for complex material phenomena, which would then expedite substantially the building of a material genome database.. 2018\n",
            "Passive Morphological Adaptation for Obstacle Avoidance in a Self-Growing Robot Produced by Additive Manufacturing. This article presents strategies for the passive path and morphological adaptation of a plant-inspired growing robot that can build its own body by an additive manufacturing process. By exploiting the soft state of the thermoplastic material used by the robot to build its structure, we analyzed the ability of the robot to change its direction of growth without the need for specific cognition and control processes. Obstacle avoidance is computed by the mechanics from the body-environment interaction. The robot can passively adapt its body to flat obstacles with an inclination of up to 50° with resulting reaction forces of up to ∼10 N. The robot also successfully performs penetration and body adaptation (with 30° obstacle inclination) in artificial soil and in a rough unstructured environment. This approach is founded on observing plant roots and how they move and passively adapt to obstacles in soil before they actively respond followed by cell division-based growth.. 2020\n",
            "The MRN complex is transcriptionally regulated by MYCN during neural cell proliferation to control replication stress. The MRE11/RAD50/NBS1 (MRN) complex is a major sensor of DNA double strand breaks, whose role in controlling faithful DNA replication and preventing replication stress is also emerging. Inactivation of the MRN complex invariably leads to developmental and/or degenerative neuronal defects, the pathogenesis of which still remains poorly understood. In particular, NBS1 gene mutations are associated with microcephaly and strongly impaired cerebellar development, both in humans and in the mouse model. These phenotypes strikingly overlap those induced by inactivation of MYCN, an essential promoter of the expansion of neuronal stem and progenitor cells, suggesting that MYCN and the MRN complex might be connected on a unique pathway essential for the safe expansion of neuronal cells. Here, we show that MYCN transcriptionally controls the expression of each component of the MRN complex. By genetic and pharmacological inhibition of the MRN complex in a MYCN overexpression model and in the more physiological context of the Hedgehog-dependent expansion of primary cerebellar granule progenitor cells, we also show that the MRN complex is required for MYCN-dependent proliferation. Indeed, its inhibition resulted in DNA damage, activation of a DNA damage response, and cell death in a MYCN- and replication-dependent manner. Our data indicate the MRN complex is essential to restrain MYCN-induced replication stress during neural cell proliferation and support the hypothesis that replication-born DNA damage is responsible for the neuronal defects associated with MRN dysfunctions.. 2016\n",

SiO2/Si core-shell nanowires array coated with gap-rich silver nanoparticles were demonstrated as a highly reproducible surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) substrate. SERS detection of a relative standard deviation of 8% for 10-4 M R6G with a spot size of ∼2 μm and 900 spots over an area of 150 × 150 μm2 was reported.

            "Mid-infrared surface plasmon polariton sensors resonant with the vibrational modes of phospholipid layers. In this work we employed micrometric subwavelength hole arrays on thin metal films as surface plasmon-based biochemical sensors. This allowed for determining, from a single mid-infrared measurement, both the thickness and the absorption spectrum of liposome adsorbed phospholipid monolayers and trilayers. Improved sensitivity is observed due to anti-crossing behavior when mid-infrared molecular vibrations frequency matches surface plasmon mode resonance. The development of optical sensors of few molecular layers is attracting considerable interest because they ensure non-contact interaction of the probing system with the target and portability for on-site biodiagnostics. Surface Plasmon Polaritons (SPP) propagating at the interface between a low-loss metal film and a dielectric medium have been exploited for increasing the sensitivity to few-molecule-thick layers, as the probing electric field is strongly confined by SPPs in the near-field region of the interface (Adato et al., P Natl Acad Sci U S A 106(46):19227–19232, 2009; Wu et al., Nat Mater 11(1):69–75, 2012; Limaj et al., Appl Phys Lett 98(9):091902, 2011). In the mid-infrared (IR) range (wavelengths λ between 2 and 10μm) many classes of biomolecules naturally display a specific vibrational spectrum which could be used for a label-free identification of the target. In this work, we present the modeling, fabrication, and spectroscopic characterization of SPP sensors working in the mid-IR range. Here, in addition, we have set by design the SPP frequency at the vibrationalmode of the target layer, in this case phospholipid mono- and multilayers representing simplified models of the cell plasma membrane.The sensor prototype was a hole array of square apertures with varying micrometric period in an Al film on Silicon substrate. The sensor was fabricated through electron beam lithography, but the ease of the design allows also for more cost effective nanoimprint techniques to be used. Finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations have been performed to analyze the electric field spatial profile associated to SPP excitation (Limaj et al., Plasmonics 8:851–858, 2013). The phospholipid layers were prepared by first depositing a monolayer on the sensor surface with a Langmuir-Blodgett trough (estimated thickness was 2.6 nm). Then the sensor has been immersed in a solution of liposomes and left for incubation, so to allow the liposomes to adsorb on the surface and fuse with the lipid monolayer. The optical response of the sensors was investigated through Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy transmittance (T) measurements. The SPP resonance profile has been fitted through a Fano lineshape and the SPP resonance frequency shift upon deposition of the phospholipid layers has been calculated. Within the same single measurement, it was possible to discriminate whether liposome fusion took place or not and identify the target fingerprints through the absorption spectrum (Fig. 22.1).. 2015\n",
            "Glucose to 5-Hydroxymethylfurfural: Origin of Site-Selectivity Resolved by Machine Learning Based Reaction Sampling. Glucose pyrolysis, a model system in biomass utilization, is renowned for its great complexity, deep in reaction network hierarchy and rich in reaction patterns. The selectivity in glucose pyrolysis, e.g., the high yield of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), a value-added platform product, remains an intriguing puzzle even after 60 years of experimental study. Here we resolve the whole reaction network of glucose pyrolysis using a global-to-global technique for reaction pathway sampling. This is achieved by establishing the first organic chemistry reaction database via stochastic surface walking (SSW) global optimization, building the global neural network (G-NN) potential via machine learning and extensively exploring the reaction network of glucose pyrolysis. In total, 6407 elementary reactions, screened out from more than 150»000 reaction pairs in glucose pyrolysis, are collected in our reaction database. The established reaction network from SSW-NN, further validated by first-principles calculations, reveals that for glucose to HMF, the lowest energy reaction pathway involves fructose and 3-deoxyglucos-2-ene (3-DGE) as key intermediates and a site-selective reaction type, retro-Michael-addition, for three consecutive dehydration steps. The overall barrier is determined to be 1.91 eV, being at least 0.19 eV lower than all previously proposed mechanisms, which assumes direct β-H elimination dehydration. The lowest pathways to the other two major products, furfural (FF) and hydroxyacetaldehyde (HAA), are also discovered with a similar barrier 1.95 eV, which exhibit a competing nature by sharing the same key intermediate, 3-ketohexose. Since chemical reactions occurring in fast glucose pyrolysis are generally present in biomass chemistry, containing essentially all reaction patterns of C-H-O elements, the methodology designed and the results presented would help to advance reaction design and mechanistic modeling in renewable fuels from biomass.. 2019\n",
            "Ion dynamics and mechanical properties of sulfonated polybenzimidazole membranes for high-temperature proton exchange membrane fuel cells. Polybenzimidazole (PBI)-based membranes are one of the systems of choice for polymer electrolyte fuel cells. Monomer sulphonation is one of the strategies suggested to improve proton transport in these membranes. We report a NMR and dynamic mechanical study aiming to investigate the effect of the sulphonation on the proton dynamics and the mechanical properties of the membranes. The analyses of <sup>1</sup>H self-diffusion coefficients and <sup>1</sup>H and <sup>31</sup>P spectra versus temperature show that sulphonation causes the formation of interchain cross-links, which involve phosphoric acid molecules and the sulfonic groups. This, in turn, reduces the proton mobility and, consequently, the ionic conductivity. The increase of the membrane stiffness with sulphonation is confirmed by dynamic mechanical analysis through the behavior of the storage modulus.. 2015\n",

            "Optical amplification enhancement in photonic crystals. Improving and controlling the efficiency of a gain medium is one of the most challenging problems of laser Research [1]. By measuring the gain length in an opal-based photonic crystal (PhC) [2] doped with laser dye, we demonstrate that optical amplification is more than twenty -fold enhanced along the -K symmetry directions of the face centered-cubic photonic crystal. The samples under study are dye doped thin-film artificial opals, from which gain is extracted by using the stripe length technique [3]: the spontaneous emitted photons, traveling in the direction of the pumped stripe, undergo an exponential amplification of the intensity as they pass through an area of population inversion. This can be quantified by the gain coefficient G which we demonstrate do depend from the propagation direction (fig 1 a). © 2011 IEEE.. 2011\n",
            "Identification, Structure-Activity Relationship, and Biological Characterization of 2,3,4,5-Tetrahydro-1 H-pyrido[4,3-b]indoles as a Novel Class of CFTR Potentiators. Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a life-threatening autosomal recessive disease, caused by mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) chloride channel. CFTR modulators have been reported to address the basic defects associated with CF-causing mutations, partially restoring the CFTR function in terms of protein processing and/or channel gating. Small-molecule compounds, called potentiators, are known to ameliorate the gating defect. In this study, we describe the identification of the 2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole core as a novel chemotype of potentiators. In-depth structure-activity relationship studies led to the discovery of enantiomerically pure 39 endowed with a good efficacy in rescuing the gating defect of F508del-and G551D-CFTR and a promising in vitro druglike profile. The in vivo characterization of γ-carboline 39 showed considerable exposure levels and good oral bioavailability, with detectable distribution to the lungs after oral administration to rats. Overall, these findings may represent an encouraging starting point to further expand this chemical class, adding a new chemotype to the existing classes of CFTR potentiators.. 2020\n",
            "Active site of catalytic ethene epoxidation: Machine-learning global pathway sampling rules out the metal sites. Ethene epoxidation on Ag-based catalysts, an important heterogeneous catalytic reaction with large-scale global wide production, has generated continuous debate on the active site of epoxidation over the past 60 years. The controversy is not only on the roles of the phase transition from Ag metal to oxidation but also on the necessity of the minority crystal facets of the Ag metal, i.e., Ag(100). Herein, we identify, via a machine-learning reaction exploration, that ethene oxidation on the Ag metal surfaces has three low-energy pathways and the most important one, the dehydrogenation of oxometallacycle intermediate (OMC-DH), is entirely overlooked previously. By computing the free energy profile and performing microkinetics simulation, we show that irrespective of the reaction conditions the dehydrogenation path is always dominant for ethene oxidation on both Ag(100) and Ag(111) metal surfaces (>90%), which rationalizes the low selectivity to combustion products (CO2and H2O) in low oxygen pressure experiments and rules out the chance of Ag metal phases being the active site of ethene epoxidation under industrial conditions (high O2 pressures). The universal presence of the OMC-DH pathway and the general low selectivity on metal sites are then confirmed by evaluating this mechanism on different catalysts. Our results highlight the power of machine-learning-based reaction exploration for resolving the complex reaction network and also point the direction to reveal the true active site of Ag-based catalyst in ethene oxidation.. 2021\n",

            "Crystal structures of salts of transition-metal halide clusters. The ion organization in crystalline salts formed by transition-metal carbonyl cluster anions containing halide ligands has been investigated. It has been shown that the presence of the heteroligand(s) drives either towards the 'trapping' of two halogen atoms within a cage of counter ions or towards the formation of anion rows insulated by cation rows. The formation of either type of pattern appears to be due to the size and mode of bonding of the halogen atoms, the first type being preferred with small terminal halogens or with large halogens in bridging bonding mode, while the second is observed with large halogens in terminal bonding mode.. 1995\n",
            "Experimental and modelling study of a dual-layer NH3 slip monolith catalyst for automotive scr aftertreatment systems. The approach to the development of a chemically and physically consistent mathematical model of ASC dual-layer (SCR + PGM) washcoated monolith converters is herein presented. Steady-state and transient kinetic runs were performed over each one of the two ASC components (SCR and PGM) in the form of powders and also over the two mixed powdered catalysts, thus acquiring information on the interactions between the SCR and the PGM catalytic chemistries. Global kinetic models were fitted to the SCR and to the PGM catalyst data, and validated against experiments performed over both washcoated single-layered SCR and PGM monoliths and over a full dual-layer ASC honeycomb catalyst (SCR layer on top). It was found that the dual-layer (SCR + PGM) ASC architecture grants increased N2 selectivities compared to a PGM-only washcoat. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.. 2013\n",
            "Does observation of postural imbalance induce a postural reaction?. Background: Several studies bring evidence that action observation elicits contagious responses during social interactions. However automatic imitative tendencies are generally inhibited and it remains unclear in which conditions mere action observation triggers motor behaviours. In this study, we addressed the question of contagious postural responses when observing human imbalance. Methodology/Principal Findings: We recorded participants' body sway while they observed a fixation cross (control condition), an upright point-light display of a gymnast balancing on a rope, and the same point-light display presented upside down. Our results showed that, when the upright stimulus was displayed prior to the inverted one, centre of pressure area and antero-posterior path length were significantly greater in the upright condition compared to the control and upside down conditions. Conclusions/Significance: These results demonstrate a contagious postural reaction suggesting a partial inefficiency of inhibitory processes. Further, kinematic information was sufficient to trigger this reaction. The difference recorded between the upright and upside down conditions indicates that the contagion effect was dependent on the integration of gravity constraints by body kinematics. Interestingly, the postural response was sensitive to habituation, and seemed to disappear when the observer was previously shown an inverted display. The motor contagion recorded here is consistent with previous work showing vegetative output during observation of an effortful movement and could indicate that lower level control facilitates contagion effects. © 2011 Tia et al.. 2011\n",
            "Correct Nucleotide Selection Is Confined at the Binding Site of Polymerase Enzymes. DNA polymerases (Pols) add incoming nucleotides (deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate (dNTPs)) to growing DNA strands, a crucial step for DNA synthesis. The insertion of correct (vs incorrect) nucleotides relates to Pols’ fidelity, which defines Pols’ ability to faithfully replicate DNA strands in a template-dependent manner. We and others have demonstrated that reactant alignment and correct base pairing at the Pols catalytic site are crucial structural features to fidelity. Here, we first used equilibrium molecular simulations to demonstrate that the local dynamics at the protein-DNA interface in the proximity of the catalytic site is different when correct vs incorrect dNTPs are bound to polymerase β (Pol β). Formation and dynamic stability of specific interatomic interactions around the incoming nucleotide influence the overall binding site architecture. This explains why certain Pols’ mutants can affect the local catalytic environment and influence the selection of correct vs incorrect nucleotides. In particular, this is here demonstrated by analyzing the interaction network formed by the residue R283, whose mutant R283A has an experimentally measured lower capacity of differentiating correct (G:dCTP) vs incorrect (G:dATP) base pairing in Pol β. We also used alchemical free-energy calculations to quantify the G:dCTP →G:dATP transformation in Pol β wild-type and mutant R283A. These results correlate well with the experimental trend, thus corroborating our mechanistic insights. Sequence and structural comparisons with other Pols from the same family suggest that these findings may also be valid in similar enzymes.. 2024\n",

            "Ok google, how could i design therapeutics against prion diseases?. A number of previous successful attempts in the search for therapeutics for a variety of human pathologies highlight the importance of computational technologies in the drug discovery pipeline. This approach, often referred to as computer-aided drug design, is unfortunately inapplicable when the precise information regarding the three-dimensional structure of disease-associated proteins or the mechanism by which they are altered to generate misfolded isoforms are missing. A typical example is represented by prion diseases, fatal pathologies of the nervous system characterized by the conformational conversion of a physiological protein called PrP C into a misfolded and infectious isoform referred to as PrP Sc . Missing information regarding the atomic structure of PrP Sc as well as the mechanism of templated conversion of PrP C has severely halted the discovery of effective therapies for prion diseases. In this manuscript, we review emerging opportunities to apply computer-aided techniques to target PrP C , PrP Sc or to design inhibitors of prion replication, and discuss how these fast-evolving technologies could lay the groundwork for the application of entirely novel rational drug design schemes for these devastating pathologies.. 2019\n",

            "Organic photovoltaic devices with colloidal TiO 2 nanorods as key functional components. We report on a novel approach to integrate colloidal anatase TiO 2 nanorods as key functional components into polymer bulk heterojunction (BHJ) photovoltaic devices by means of mild, all-solution-based processing techniques. The successful integration of colloidal nanoparticles in organic solar cells relies on the ability to remove the long chain insulating ligands, which indeed severely reduces the charge transport. To this aim we have exploited the concomitant mechanisms of UV-light-driven photocatalytic removal of adsorbed capping ligands and hydrophilicization of TiO 2 surfaces in both solid-state and liquid-phase conditions. We have demonstrated the successful integration of the UV-irradiated films and colloidal solutions of TiO 2 nanorods in inverted and conventional solar cell geometries, respectively. The inverted devices show a power conversion efficiency of 2.3% that is a ca. three times improvement over their corresponding cell counterparts incorporating untreated TiO 2, demonstrating the excellent electron-collecting property of the UV-irradiated TiO 2 films. The integration of UV-treated TiO 2 solutions in conventional devices results in doubled power conversion efficiency for the thinner active layer and in maximum power conversion efficiency of 2.8% for 110 nm thick devices. In addition, we have demonstrated, with the support of device characterizations and optical simulations, that the TiO 2 nanocrystal buffer layer acts both as electron-transporting/hole-blocking material and optical spacer. © 2011 The Owner Societies.. 2012\n",

            "The Inhibitory Effect of Hydroxylated Carbon Nanotubes on the Aggregation of Human Islet Amyloid Polypeptide Revealed by a Combined Computational and Experimental Study. Fibrillar deposits formed by the aggregation of the human islet amyloid polypeptide (hIAPP) are the major pathological hallmark of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Inhibiting the aggregation of hIAPP is considered the primary therapeutic strategy for the treatment of T2DM. Hydroxylated carbon nanoparticles have received great attention in impeding amyloid protein fibrillation owing to their reduced cytotoxicity compared to the pristine ones. In this study, we investigated the influence of hydroxylated single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT-OHs) on the first step of hIAPP aggregation: dimerization by performing explicit solvent replica exchange molecular dynamics (REMD) simulations. Extensive REMD simulations demonstrate that SWCNT-OHs can dramatically inhibit interpeptide β-sheet formation and completely suppress the previously reported β-hairpin amyloidogenic precursor of hIAPP. On the basis of our simulation results, we proposed that SWCNT-OH can hinder hIAPP fibrillation. This was further confirmed by our systematic turbidity measurements, thioflavin T fluorescence, circular dichroism (CD), transmission electron microscope (TEM), and atomic force microscopy (AFM) experiments. Detailed analyses of hIAPP-SWCNT-OH interactions reveal that hydrogen bonding, van der Waals, and π-stacking interactions between hIAPP and SWCNT-OH significantly weaken the inter- and intrapeptide interactions that are crucial for β-sheet formation.

            "Differential cell adhesion on mesoporous silicon substrates. Porous silicon (PSi) is a promising material in several biomedical applications because of its biocompatibility and biodegradability. Despite the plethora of studies focusing on the interaction of cells with micrometer and submicro geometrical features, limited information is available on the response of cells to substrates with a quasi-regular distribution of nanoscopic pores. Here, the behavior of four different cell types is analyzed on two mesoporous (MeP) silicon substrates, with an average pore size of ∼5 (MeP1) and ∼20 nm (MeP2), respectively. On both MeP substrates, cells are observed to spread and adhere in a larger number as compared to flat silicon wafers. At all considered time points, the surface density of the adhering cells n d is larger on the PSi substrate with the smaller average pore size (MeP1). At 60 h, n d is from ∼1.5 to 5 times larger on MeP1 than on MeP2 substrates, depending on the cell type. The higher rates of proliferation are observed for the two neuronal cell types, the mouse neuroblastoma cells (N2A) and the immortalized human cortical neuronal cells (HCN1A). It is speculated that the higher adhesion on MeP1 could be attributed to a preferential matching of the substrate topography with the recently observed multiscale molecular architecture of focal adhesions. These results have implications in the rational development of PSi substrates for supporting cell adhesion and controlling drug release in implants and scaffolds for tissue engineering applications. © 2012 American Chemical Society.. 2012\n",

We studied the carrier confinement in tetrapod-shaped colloidal CdTe nanocrystals by means of absorption, photoluminescence, and photoluminescence excitation spectroscopy at room and cryogenic temperatures. The spectra show features characteristic of the tetrapod shape together with a clear dependence on the dominant confinement parameter, i.e., the diameter of the tetrapod arm. Theoretical calculations based on an envelope-function approximation and using the exact tetrapod shape have been performed to assign the observed spectral features. Oscillator strength and size dependence of the transitions energy have been calculated showing a direct correlation between the oscillator strength and the nanocrystal shape. © 2005 American Institute of Physics.. 2005\n",
            "Longitudinal and lateral slip control of autonomous wheeled mobile robot for trajectory tracking. This research formulates a path-following control problem subjected to wheel slippage and skid and solves it using a logic-based control scheme for a wheeled mobile robot (WMR). The novelty of the proposed scheme lies in its methodology that considers both longitudinal and lateral slip components. Based on the derived slip model, the controller for longitudinal motion slip has been synthesized. Various control parameters have been studied to investigate their effects on the performance of the controller resulting in selection of their optimum values. The designed controller for lateral slip or skid is based on the proposed side friction model and skid check condition. Considering a car-like WMR, simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme. The robot successfully followed the desired circular trajectory in the presence of wheel slippage and skid. This research finds its potential in various applications involving WMR navigation and control.. 2015\n",
            "Modeling PrPSc Generation Through Deformed Templating. Deformed templating is the process by which self-replicating protein conformations with a given cross-β folding pattern can seed formation of an alternative self-replicating state with different cross-β folding pattern. In particular, uninfectious but propagative PrP amyloid can transform into a bona fide infectious conformer, PrPSc through deformed templating. The process can take many rounds of replication (if taking place in vitro) or even several passages of the evolving PrP conformers through successive brains if in vivo, through experimental transmission. In all cases, deformed templating involves a forced conversion in which there is a mismatch between the template and the substrate and/or the templating environment, typically a recombinant PrP amyloid, adept at converting recombinant PrP under denaturing conditions (e.g., presence of chaotropic agents), encountering a glycosylated, GPI-anchored PrPC substrate under physiological conversion conditions. Deformed templating is characterized by emergence of intermediate conformers that exhibit biochemical characteristics that are intermediate between those of the initial PrP amyloid and the final PrPSc conformers. Here, we took advantage of the recent elucidation of the structure of a PrP amyloid by cryo-EM and the availability of a physically plausible atomistic model of PrPSc that we have recently proposed. Using modeling and Molecular Dynamics (MD) approaches, we built a complete molecular modelization of deformed templating, including an atomistic model of a glycosylated intermediate conformer and a modified model of PrPSc. Among other unanticipated outcomes, our results show that fully glycosylated PrP can be stacked in-register, and how 4-rung β-solenoid (4RβS) PrP architectures can share key structural motifs with parallel-in register intermolecular sheet (PIRIBS) PrP amyloids. Our results shed light on the mechanisms of prion replication.. 2020\n",

The diagnosis and monitoring of HCV infection is a crucial need in the clinical management. The conventional diagnostic technologies are challenged when trying to address molecular diagnostics, especially because they require a complex and time-consuming sample preparation phase. Here, a new concept based on surface functionalization was applied to viral RNA purification: first of all polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) flat surfaces were modified to hold RNA adsorption. After a careful chemical and morphological analysis of the modified surfaces, the functionalization protocols giving the best RNA adsorbing surfaces were applied to PDMS microdevices. The functionalized microdevices were then used for RNA purification from HCV infected human plasma samples. RNA purification and RT were successfully performed in the same microdevice chamber, saving time of analysis, reagents, and labor. The PCR protocol for HCV cDNA amplification was also implemented in the microdevice, demonstrating that the entire process of HCV analysis, from plasma to molecular readout, could be performed on-chip. Not only HCV but also other microdevice-based viral RNA detection could therefore result in a successful Point-of-Care (POC) diagnostics for resource-limited settings.. 2016\n",

Four new benzofulvene derivatives bearing bithiophene chromophores at two different key positions of the phenylindene scaffold were prepared in order to evaluate the role of different chromophores in the optoelectronic features of polybenzofulvene derivatives. The results of the photophysical studies showed that the optical properties of the newly-synthesized bithiophene-functionalized polymers were affected by both the polymer enchainment and the substitution topology of the monomeric units. On the other hand, the hole-mobility appeared to be affected to a lesser extent, but the best performances were obtained in poly-6-HBT-BF3k showing the strongest bithiophene side chain packing. This work demonstrates that the optoelectronic properties of polybenzofulvene derivatives can be optimized by a targeted chemical design such as side chain engineering.. 2015\n",
            "Immunology of biodegradable nanoparticles: a brief overview on a wide growing field. Immunity is continuously evolving by evolutionary mechanisms shaped by pathogenic stimuli of different kinds. Man-made nanomaterials (NMs) have been developed in the last decades and represent a novel challenge for our immune system, especially when applied to medical science. Toxicological studies of such nanoparticles (NPs) revealed that size, shape, and surface chemistry are key parameters to understand their noxious effects on cellular mechanisms. Less is known on the immune reactions to NMs since prolonged exposure data are not so detailed as the results for acute administration. The importance of immunity to biocompatible NPs is underlined by their increasing use as drug or gene delivery carriers in common pharmaceutical preparations and vaccines. In the latter case, the immunomodulatory properties of NMs allow their use also as efficient adjuvants to enhance the innate immune response. In the current manuscript, the authors discuss the main concepts in this fast-growing field by restricting our view to NMs with consolidated application in biomedicine.. 2021\n",
            "Pharmacological inactivation of the prion protein by targeting a folding intermediate. Recent computational advancements in the simulation of biochemical processes allow investigating the mechanisms involved in protein regulation with realistic physics-based models, at an atomistic level of resolution. These techniques allowed us to design a drug discovery approach, named Pharmacological Protein Inactivation by Folding Intermediate Targeting (PPI-FIT), based on the rationale of negatively regulating protein levels by targeting folding intermediates. Here, PPI-FIT was tested for the first time on the cellular prion protein (PrP), a cell surface glycoprotein playing a key role in fatal and transmissible neurodegenerative pathologies known as prion diseases. We predicted the all-atom structure of an intermediate appearing along the folding pathway of PrP and identified four different small molecule ligands for this conformer, all capable of selectively lowering the load of the protein by promoting its degradation. Our data support the notion that the level of target proteins could be modulated by acting on their folding pathways, implying a previously unappreciated role for folding intermediates in the biological regulation of protein expression.. 2021\n",
            "In situ ray tracing and computational steering for interactive blood flow simulation. Recent algorithm and hardware developments have significantly improved our capability to interactively visualise time-varying flow fields. However, when visualising very large dynamically varying datasets interactively there are still limitations in the scalability and efficiency of these methods. Here we present a rendering pipeline which employs an efficient in situ ray tracing technique to visualise flow fields as they are simulated. The ray casting approach is particularly well suited for the visualisation of large and sparse time-varying datasets, where it is capable of rendering fluid flow fields at high image resolutions and at interactive frame rates on a single multi-core processor using OpenMP. The parallel implementation of our in situ visualisation method relies on MPI, requires no specialised hardware support, and employs the same underlying spatial decomposition as the fluid simulator. The visualisation pipeline allows the user to operate on a commodity computer and explore the simulation output interactively. Our simulation environment incorporates numerous features that can be utilised in a wide variety of research contexts. Crown Copyright © 2009.. 2010\n",
            "IFN-γ orchestrates mesenchymal stem cell plasticity through the signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 and 3 and mammalian target of rapamycin pathways. Background Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) display a therapeutic plasticity because of their ability to modulate immunity, foster tissue repair, and differentiate into mesodermal cells. IFN-γ has been described to differently affect human mesenchymal stem cell (hMSC) and mouse mesenchymal stem cell (mMSC) immunomodulation and differentiation, depending on the inflammatory milieu. Objective We aimed at dissecting the relevant intracellular pathways through which IFN-γ affects MSC plasticity and the consequence of their manipulation on MSC functions. Methods Modification of relevant IFN-γ–dependent pathways in mMSCs was carried out in vitro through gene silencing or chemical inhibition of key components. Functional outcomes were assessed by means of Western blotting, real-time PCR, differentiation, and proliferation assays on MSCs. The effect on T cells was addressed by T-cell proliferation assays; the effect of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) manipulation in MSCs was studied in vivo in a mouse model of delayed-type hypersensitivity assay. To address whether similar mechanisms are involved also in hMSCs on IFN-γ stimulation, the effect of chemical inhibition on the same intracellular pathways was assessed by means of Western blotting, and the final outcome on immunomodulatory properties was evaluated based on real-time PCR and T-cell proliferation. Results We revealed that in mMSCs IFN-γ–induced immunoregulation is mediated by early phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 1 and STAT3, which is significantly enhanced by an extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2–dependent mTOR inhibition, thereby promoting pSTAT1 nuclear translocation. Accordingly, after intracellular mTOR inhibition, MSCs augmented their ability to inhibit T-cell proliferation and control delayed-type hypersensitivity in vivo. Similarly, on mTOR blockade, hMSCs also enhanced their immunoregulatory features. A sustained exposure to IFN-γ led to inhibition of STAT3 activity, which in mMSCs resulted in an impaired proliferation and differentiation. Conclusion These results provide new insights about MSC intracellular pathways affected by IFN-γ, demonstrating that pharmacologic or genetic manipulation of MSCs can enhance their immunomodulatory functions, which could be translated into novel therapeutic approaches.. 2017\n",

            "Nonlinear refraction of hard x rays. We study the nonlinear refraction of x rays in highly ionized condensed matter by using a classical model of a cold electron plasma in a lattice of still ions coupled with Maxwell equations. By employing a group-theoretical technique, we reduce the governing equations of the system to an integrable set of nonlinear ordinary differential equations, discussing the existence and stability of nonlinear waves. This allows us to define the effective Kerr coefficient n2 at x rays. With reference to real-world crystalline materials (B, C, Li, and Na), we consider beam self-defocusing and predict that nonlinear processes become comparable to the linear ones for focused beams with powers on the order of m c3/r0 (≈10 GW), the classical electron power. As a consequence, nonlinear phenomena are expected to largely affect imaging experiments in currently exploited x-ray free-electron lasers and in their future developments. © 2008 The American Physical Society.. 2008\n",
            "Addressing the effects of gas adsorption on monolayers beyond charge population analysis: the case of WS2. The optoelectronic properties of two-dimensional (2D) materials can be significantly influenced by charge transfer resulting from surface molecular adsorption. One noteworthy example is observed in WS2 monolayers, where the behavior undergoes an anomalous change when exposed to air, primarily due to the adsorption of oxygen molecules. While the acceptor nature of O2 is widely acknowledged as the underlying cause, the precise electron transfer mechanism remains in need of a comprehensive explanation at the atomistic level. Going beyond conventional charge population analysis, we develop an approach describing the process of molecular adsorption and surface charge transfer that relies on the formalism commonly adopted for charged defects in semiconductors. This method clearly identifies two key factors contributing to electron transfer upon O2 physisorption: the presence of sulphur vacancies and the intrinsic n-type nature of WS2. This approach provides an effective and general scheme to characterize the surface charge transfer in 2D materials exposed to a gas atmosphere.. 2024\n",

In developing physical theories, analogical reasoning has been found to be very powerful, as attested by a number of important historical examples. An analogy between two apparently different phenomena, once established, allows one to transfer information and bring new concepts from one phenomenon to the other. Here, we discuss an important analogy between two widely different physical problems, namely, the Jahn–Teller distortion in molecular physics and the Rashba spin splitting in condensed matter physics. By exploring their conceptual and mathematical features and by searching for the counterparts between them, we examine the orbital texture in Jahn–Teller systems, as the counterpart of the spin texture of the Rashba physics, and put forward a possible way of experimentally detecting the orbital texture. Finally, we discuss the analogy by comparing the coexistence of linear Rashba + Dresselhaus effects and Jahn–Teller problems for specific symmetries, which allow for nontrivial spin and orbital textures, respectively.. 2016\n",

Two-dimensional (2D) materials as tungsten disulphide (WS2) are rising as the ideal platform for the next generation of nanoscale devices due to the excellent electric-transport and optical properties. However, the presence of defects in the as grown samples represents one of the main limiting factors for commercial applications. At the same time, WS2 properties are frequently tailored by introducing impurities at specific sites. Aim of this review paper is to present a complete description and discussion of the effects of both intentional and unintentional defects in WS2, by an in depth analysis of the recent experimental and theoretical investigations reported in the literature. First, the most frequent intrinsic defects in WS2 are presented and their effects in the readily synthetized material are discussed. Possible solutions to remove and heal unintentional defects are also analyzed. Following, different doping schemes are reported, including the traditional substitution approach and innovative techniques based on the surface charge transfer with adsorbed atoms or molecules.

A porous anodic alumina sample with ordered channels was studied in order to characterise its efficiency as a positron-positronium converter at cryogenic temperatures. The effects of gas adsorption were found to be vacuum dependent and considerable up to 200 nm depth inside the sample. At higher depths it was possible to identify a temperature dependent positronium formation mechanism and the related activation energy was determined to be in an interval from 8.7 to 16 meV.

            "Prism adaptation by mental practice. The prediction of our actions and their interaction with the external environment is critical for sensorimotor adaptation. For instance, during prism exposure, which deviates laterally our visual field, we progressively correct movement errors by combining sensory feedback with forward model sensory predictions. However, very often we project our actions to the external environment without physically interacting with it (e.g., mental actions). An intriguing question is whether adaptation will occur if we imagine, instead of executing, an arm movement while wearing prisms. Here, we investigated prism adaptation during mental actions. In the first experiment, participants (n=54) performed arm pointing movements before and after exposure to the optical device. They were equally divided into six groups according to prism exposure: Prisms-Active, Prisms-Imagery, Prisms-Stationary, Prisms-Stationary-Attention, No Conflict-Prisms-Imagery, No Prisms-Imagery. Adaptation, measured by the difference in pointing errors between pre-test and post-test, occurred only in Prisms-Active and Prisms-Imagery conditions. The second experiment confirmed the results of the first experiment and further showed that sensorimotor adaptation was mainly due to proprioceptive realignment in both Prisms-Active (n=10) and Prisms-Imagery (n=10) groups. In both experiments adaptation was greater following actual than imagined pointing movements. The present results are the first demonstration of prism adaptation by mental practice under prism exposure and they are discussed in terms of internal forward models and sensorimotor plasticity. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.. 2013\n",
            "miRNAs are essential for survival and differentiation of newborn neurons but not for expansion of neural progenitors during early neurogenesis in the mouse embryonic neocortex. Neurogenesis during the development of the mammalian cerebral cortex involves a switch of neural stem and progenitor cells from proliferation to differentiation. To explore the possible role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in this process, we conditionally ablated Dicer in the developing mouse neocortex using Emx1-Cre, which is specifically expressed in the dorsal telencephalon as early as embryonic day (E) 9.5. Dicer ablation in neuroepithelial cells, which are the primary neural stem and progenitor cells, and in the neurons derived from them, was evident from E10.5 onwards, as ascertained by the depletion of the normally abundant miRNAs miR-9 and miR-124. Dicer ablation resulted in massive hypotrophy of the postnatal cortex and death of the mice shortly after weaning. Analysis of the cytoarchitecture of the Dicer-ablated cortex revealed a marked reduction in radial thickness starting at E13.5, and defective cortical layering postnatally. Whereas the former was due to neuronal apoptosis starting at E12.5, which was the earliest detectable phenotype, the latter reflected dramatic impairment of neuronal differentiation. Remarkably, the primary target cells of Dicer ablation, the neuroepithelial cells, and the neurogenic progenitors derived from them, were unaffected by miRNA depletion with regard to cell cycle progression, cell division, differentiation and viability during the early stage of neurogenesis, and only underwent apoptosis starting at E14.5. Our results support the emerging concept that progenitors are less dependent on miRNAs than their differentiated progeny, and raise interesting perspectives as to the expansion of somatic stem cells.. 2008\n",

While the OEP-based self-consistency does not provide any improvement for the calculations of ground-state total energies and ionization potentials, it does improve the accuracy of electron affinities and restores the meaning of the LUMO orbital energy as being connected to a neutral excitation energy.

It has been recently suggested that the coexistence of ferroelectricity and Rashba-like spin-splitting effects due to spin-orbit coupling in a single material may allow for a nonvolatile electric control of spin degrees of freedom. In the present work, we compared the structural and ferroelectric properties of tetragonal and rhombohedral phases of ferroelectric BiAlO3 by means of density-functional calculations. In both phases, we carefully investigated Rashba and Dresselhaus effects, giving rise to spin-splitting in their bulk electronic structure, particularly near the conduction band minimum, supplementing our first-principles results with an effective k·p model analysis. The full reversal of the spin texture with ferroelectric polarization switching was also predicted.

            "Order at Extreme Dilution. Control over the organization of assemblies from molecular dimensions up to the macroscopic length scale is an outstanding challenge in science, above all for materials in high dilution. Instead of inducing order by generating very long and stiff structures, an alternative approach is studied: a two-component assembly of a semiflexible polymer with a (self-assembling) chromonic liquid crystal. By following the structure formation in time using different techniques, a mechanistic model is proposed that explains how such unusually well-defined materials can be created from flexible components. It is concluded that at this very low concentration (>99.6% water), these macroscopically organized structures can only be formed when the energies between different assembly states and their interconversion rates are properly balanced. This may, however, be in reach for a wide range of materials, which makes this a generic route toward high definition at low concentration without the need for long and rigid building blocks.. 2016\n",
            "Electrophysiological correlates of biological motion permanence in humans. Spatiotemporal discontinuity of visual input is a common occurrence in daily life. For example, when a walking person disappears temporarily behind a wall, observers have a clear sense of his physical presence despite the absence of any visual information (movement permanence). To investigate the neural substrates of biological motion permanence, we recorded scalp EEG activity of sixteen subjects while they passively observed either biological or scrambled motion disappearing behind an occluder and reappearing. The moment of the occluder's appearance was either fixed or randomized. The statistical comparison between the biological and scrambled motion ERP waveforms revealed a modulation of activity in centro-parietal and right occipito-temporal regions during the occlusion phase when the biological motion disappearance was time-locked, possibly reflecting the recall of sensorimotor representations. These representations might allow the prediction of moving organisms in occlusion conditions. When the appearance of the occluder was unpredictable there was no difference between biological and scrambled motion either before or during occlusion, indicating that temporal prediction is relevant to the processing of biological motion permanence. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.. 2013\n",

Determining the location and nature of the electron pairs within a molecule provides an intuitive representation of electronic structures. Yet, most of the available theoretical representations are not suitable for describing excited state phenomena. The density overlap region indicator (DORI) scalar field, which depends only on the density and its derivatives, overcomes previous limitations, while keeping the intuitiveness of popular scalar fields. Here, its usefulness is demonstrated by pinpointing visual and numerical DORI signatures for both intra- and intermolecular excited state situations.. 2016\n",

            "Hydrodynamics of flagellated microswimmers near free-slip interfaces. The hydrodynamics of a flagellated micro-organism is investigated when swimming close to a planar free-slip surface by means of numerical solutions of the Stokes equations obtained via a boundary element method. Depending on the initial conditions, the swimmer can either escape from the free-slip surface or collide with the boundary. Interestingly, the micro-organism does not exhibit a stable orbit. Independently of escape or attraction to the interface, close to a free-slip surface, the swimmer follows a counter-clockwise trajectory, in agreement with experimental findings (Di Leonardo et al., Phys. Rev. Lett., vol. 106 (3), 2011, 038101). The hydrodynamics is indeed modified by the free surface. In fact, when the same swimmer moves close to a no-slip wall, a set of initial conditions exists which result in stable orbits. Moreover, when moving close to a free-slip or a no-slip boundary, the swimmer assumes a different orientation with respect to its trajectory. Taken together, these results contribute to shed light on the hydrodynamical behaviour of micro-organisms close to liquid-air interfaces which are relevant for the formation of interfacial biofilms of aerobic bacteria.. 2016\n",

            "Absolute and direct microRNA quantification using DNA-gold nanoparticle probes. DNA-gold nanoparticle probes are implemented in a simple strategy for direct microRNA (miRNA) quantification. Fluorescently labeled DNA-probe strands are immobilized on PEGylated gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). In the presence of target miRNA, DNA-RNA heteroduplexes are formed and become substrate for the endonuclease DSN (duplex-specific nuclease). Enzymatic hydrolysis of the DNA strands yields a fluorescence signal due to diffusion of the fluorophores away from the gold surface. We show that the molecular design of our DNA-AuNP probes, with the DNA strands immobilized on top of the PEG-based passivation layer, results in nearly unaltered enzymatic activity toward immobilized heteroduplexes compared to substrates free in solution. The assay, developed in a real-time format, allows absolute quantification of as little as 0.2 fmol of miR-203. We also show the application of the assay for direct quantification of cancer-related miR-203 and miR-21 in samples of extracted total RNA from cell cultures. The possibility of direct and absolute quantification may significantly advance the use of microRNAs as biomarkers in the clinical praxis. © 2014 American Chemical Society.. 2014\n",

The continuous increasing of engineered nanomaterials (ENMs) in our environment, their combinatorial diversity, and the associated genotoxic risks, highlight the urgent need to better define the possible toxicological effects of ENMs. In this context, we present a new high-throughput screening (HTS) platform based on the cytokinesis-block micronucleus (CBMN) assay, lab-on-chip cell sorting, and automated image analysis. This HTS platform has been successfully applied to the evaluation of the cytotoxic and genotoxic effects of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) and silica nanoparticles (SiO2NPs). In particular, our results demonstrate the high cyto- and genotoxicity induced by AgNPs and the biocompatibility of SiO2NPs, in primary human lymphocytes. Moreover, our data reveal that the toxic effects are also dependent on size, surface coating, and surface charge. Most importantly, our HTS platform shows that AgNP-induced genotoxicity is lymphocyte sub-type dependent and is particularly pronounced in CD2+ and CD4+ cells. A new high-throughput screening (HTS) platform is reported based on the cytokinesis-block micronucleus (CBMN) assay, lab-on-chip cell sorting, and automated image analysis.

            "SINEUP non-coding RNAs rescue defective frataxin expression and activity in a cellular model of Friedreich's Ataxia. Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA) is an untreatable disorder with neuro- and cardio-degenerative progression. This monogenic disease is caused by the hyper-expansion of naturally occurring GAA repeats in the first intron of the FXN gene, encoding for frataxin, a protein implicated in the biogenesis of iron-sulfur clusters. As the genetic defect interferes with FXN transcription, FRDA patients express a normal frataxin protein but at insufficient levels. Thus, current therapeutic strategies are mostly aimed to restore physiological FXN expression. We have previously described SINEUPs, natural and synthetic antisense long non-coding RNAs, which promote translation of partially overlapping mRNAs through the activity of an embedded SINEB2 domain. Here, by in vitro screening, we have identified a number of SINEUPs targeting human FXN mRNA and capable to up-regulate frataxin protein to physiological amounts acting at the post-transcriptional level. Furthermore, FXN-specific SINEUPs promote the recovery of disease-associated mitochondrial aconitase defects in FRDA-derived cells. In summary, we provide evidence that SINEUPs may be the first gene-specific therapeutic approach to activate FXN translation in FRDA and, more broadly, a novel scalable platform to develop new RNA-based therapies for haploinsufficient diseases.. 2019\n",

Polydopamine nanoparticles (PDA NPs) are proposed as an anti-cancer tool against hepatocellular carcinoma through the combination of near-infrared (NIR)-mediated hyperthermia and loading with a chemotherapeutic drug, sorafenib (SRF). Cell membranes isolated from a liver cancer cell line (HepG2) have been exploited for the coating of the nanoparticles (thus obtaining CM-SRF-PDA NPs), to promote homotypic targeting toward cancer cells. The selective targeting ability and the combined photothermal and chemotherapeutic activity of the CM-SRF-PDA NPs following NIR irradiation have been evaluated on cell cultures in static and dynamic conditions, besides three-dimensional culture models. Eventually, the therapeutic effectiveness of the proposed approach has also been tested ex ovo on HepG2 spheroid-grafted quail embryos.

Traditional in vitro diagnostics requires specialized laboratories and costly instrumentation, both for the amplification of nucleic acid targets (usually achieved by PCR) and for the assay readout, often based on fluorescence. We are developing hybrid nanomaterials-based sensors for the rapid and low-cost diagnosis of various disease biomarkers, for applications in portable platforms for diagnostics at the point-of-care. To this aim, we exploited the size and distancedependent optical properties of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) to achieve colorimetric detection. Moreover, in order to avoid the complexity of thermal cycles associated to traditional PCR, the design of our systems includes signal amplification schemes, achieved by the use of enzymes (nucleases, helicase) or DNAzymes. Focused on instrument-free and sensitive detection, we carefully combined the intrinsic sensitivity by multivalency of functionalized AuNPs with isothermal and non-stringent enzyme-aided reaction conditions, controlled AuNPs aggregates, universal reporters and magnetic microparticles, the latter used both as a substrate and as a means for the colorimetric detection. We obtained simple and robust assays for the sensitive (pM range or better) naked-eye detection of cancer or infectious diseases (HPV, HCV) biomarkers, requiring no instrumentation except for a simple heating plate.

            "Design and optimization of polymer nanoshuttles for nanomedicine. Current advances in nanotechnology hold the promises to greatly impact on current medical practice. Since nanometric materials interact with cells, tissue and organs at a molecular level, they may be used as probes for ultrasensitive molecular sensing and diagnostic imaging or carriers for drug and gene delivery. However, along with the excitement that has driven the development of novel nanocarriers, there have been increasing concerns regarding the risks these materials may generate. As these nanostructures are intentionally engineered to target specific cells or tissues, it is imperative to ensure their safety. The optimal design of safe and functional nanocarriers for medicine requires a better understanding of the interaction between the physical-chemistry properties of the nanoparticle surface with the complex protein machinery existing at the cell membrane. In particular the effect of the particles properties (charge, shape, protein coating) on the mechanism of cellular uptake is highly relevant both to assess the real biological risks coupled with the use of nanomaterial (nanopathology and nanotoxicology) and to engineer carriers able to improve the medical practice. The nanometric size and the surface molecular decoration may activate mechanisms of cellular uptake different from those commonly used by cells: these open the possibility to activated/modulated the membrane crossing by tuning chemical-physical properties of nanometric materials. In this work, the design and production of novel degradable polymeric nanocavities via layer-by-layer and temperature induced phase separation technology will be presented along with a detailed characterization of their in vitro performances.

            "Negligible particle-specific toxicity mechanism of silver nanoparticles: The role of Ag+ ion release in the cytosol. Toxicity of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) is supported by many observations in literature, but no mechanism details have been proved yet. Here we confirm and quantify the toxic potential of fully characterized AgNPs in HeLa and A549 cells. Notably, through a specific fluorescent probe, we demonstrate the intracellular release of Ag+ ions in living cells after nanoparticle internalization, showing that in-situ particle degradation is promoted by the acidic lysosomal environment. The activation of metallothioneins in response to AgNPs and the possibility to reverse the main toxic pathway by Ag+ chelating agents demonstrate a cause/effect relationship between ions and cell death. We propose that endocytosed AgNPs are degraded in the lysosomes and the release of Ag+ ions in the cytosol induces cell damages, while ions released in the cell culture medium play a negligible effect. These findings will be useful to develop safer-by-design nanoparticles and proper regulatory guidelines of AgNPs.. 2015\n",

            "Nanoscale Transformations in Covellite (CuS) Nanocrystals in the Presence of Divalent Metal Cations in a Mild Reducing Environment. We studied the structural and compositional transformations of colloidal covellite (CuS) nanocrystals (and of djurleite (Cu1.94S) nanocrystals as a control) when exposed to divalent cations, as Cd2+ and Hg2+, at room temperature in organic solvents. All the experiments were run in the absence of phosphines, which are a necessary ingredient for cation exchange reactions involving copper chalcogenides, as they strongly bind to the expelled Cu+ ions. Under these experimental conditions, no remarkable reactivity was indeed seen for both CuS and Cu1.94S nanocrystals. On the other hand, in the covellite structure 2/3 of sulfur atoms form covalent S-S bonds. This peculiarity suggests that the combined presence of electron donors and of foreign metal cations can trigger the entry of both electrons and cations in the covellite lattice, causing reorganization of the anion framework due to the rupture of the S-S bonds. In Cu1.94S, which lacks S-S bonds, this mechanism should not be accessible. This hypothesis was proven by the experimental evidence that adding ascorbic acid increased the fraction of metal ions incorporated in the covellite nanocrystals, while it had no noticeable effect on the Cu1.94S ones. Once inside the covellite particles, Cd2+ and Hg2+ cations engaged in exchange reactions, pushing the expelled Cu+ ions toward the not-yet exchanged regions in the same particles, or out to the solution, from where they could be recaptured by other covellite nanoparticles/domains. Because no good solvating agent for Cu ions was present in solution, they essentially remained in the nanocrystals.. 2015\n",

Hybrid perovskites are among the most promising materials for optoelectronic applications. Their 2D crystalline form is even more interesting since the alternating inorganic and organic layers naturally forge a multiple quantum-well structure, leading to the formation of stable excitonic resonances. Nevertheless, a controlled modulation of the quantum well width, which is defined by the number of inorganic layers (n) between two organic ones, is not trivial and represents the main synthetic challenge in the field. Here, a conceptually innovative approach to easily tune n in lead iodide perovskite single-crystalline flakes is presented. The judicious use of potassium iodide is found to modulate the supersaturation levels of the precursors solution without being part of the final products. This allows to obtain a fine tuning of the n value. The excellent optical quality of the as synthesized flakes guarantees an in-depth analysis by Fourier-space microscopy, revealing that the excitons orientation can be manipulated by modifying the number of inorganic layers. Excitonic out-of-plane component, indeed, is enhanced when “n” is increased. The combined advances in the synthesis and optical characterization fill in the picture of the exciton behavior in low-dimensional perovskite, paving the way to the design of materials with improved optoelectronic characteristics.. 2021\n",

The investigation of the ability to perceive, recognize, and judge upon social intentions, such as communicative intentions, on the basis of body motion is a growing research area. Cross-cultural differences in ability to perceive and interpret biological motion, however, have been poorly investigated so far. Progress in this domain strongly depends on the availability of suitable stimulus material. In the present method paper, we describe the multilingual CID-5, an extension of the CID-5 database, allowing for the investigation of how non-conventional communicative gestures are classified and identified by speakers of different languages. The CID-5 database contains 14 communicative interactions and 7 non-communicative actions performed by couples of agents and presented as point-light displays. For each action, the database provides movie files with the point-light animation, text files with the 3-D spatial coordinates of the point-lights, and five different response alternatives. In the multilingual CID-5 the alternatives were translated into seven languages (Chinese, Dutch, English, French, German, Italian, and Polish). Preliminary data collected to assess the recognizability of the actions in the different languages suggest that, for most of the action stimuli, information presented in point-light displays is sufficient for the distinctive classification of the action as communicative vs. individual, as well as for identification of the specific communicative gesture performed by the actor in all the available languages.. 2015\n",

The detection of consistent feature points in an image is fundamental for various kinds of computer vision techniques, such as stereo matching, object recognition, target tracking and optical flow computation. This paper presents an event-based approach to the detection of corner points, which benefits from the high temporal resolution, compressed visual information and low latency provided by an asynchronous neuromorphic event-based camera. The proposed method adapts the commonly used Harris corner detector to the event-based data, in which frames are replaced by a stream of asynchronous events produced in response to local light changes at μs temporal resolution. Responding only to changes in its field of view, an event-based camera naturally enhances edges in the scene, simplifying the detection of corner features. We characterised and tested the method on both a controlled pattern and a real scenario, using the dynamic vision sensor (DVS) on the neuromorphic iCub robot. The method detects corners with a typical error distribution within 2 pixels. The error is constant for different motion velocities and directions, indicating a consistent detection across the scene and over time. We achieve a detection rate proportional to speed, higher than frame-based technique for a significant amount of motion in the scene, while also reducing the computational cost.. 2016\n",

Hybrid interfaces between organic semiconductors and living tissues represent a new tool for in-vitro and in-vivo applications. In particular, conjugated polymers display several optimal properties as substrates for biological systems, such as good biocompatibility, excellent mechanical properties, cheap and easy processing technology, and possibility of deposition on light, thin and flexible substrates. These materials have been employed for cellular interfaces like neural probes, transistors for excitation and recording of neural activity, biosensors and actuators for drug release. Recent experiments have also demonstrated the possibility to use conjugated polymers for all-optical modulation of the electrical activity of cells. Several in-vitro study cases have been reported, including primary neuronal networks, astrocytes and secondary line cells. Moreover, signal photo-transduction mediated by organic polymers has been shown to restore light sensitivity in degenerated retinas, suggesting that these devices may be used for artificial retinal prosthesis in the future. All in all, light sensitive conjugated polymers represent a new approach for optical modulation of cellular activity. In this work, all the steps required to fabricate a bio-polymer interface for optical excitation of living cells are described. The function of the active interface is to transduce the light stimulus into a modulation of the cell membrane potential. As a study case, useful for in-vitro studies, a polythiophene thin film is used as the functional, light absorbing layer, and Human Embryonic Kidney (HEK-293) cells are employed as the biological component of the interface. Practical examples of successful control of the cell membrane potential upon stimulation with light pulses of different duration are provided. In particular, it is shown that both depolarizing and hyperpolarizing effects on the cell membrane can be achieved depending on the duration of the light stimulus.

            "Molecular dynamics simulations provide insights into the substrate specificity of FAOX family members. Enzymatic assays based on Fructosyl Amino Acid Oxidases (FAOX) represent a potential, rapid and economical strategy to measure glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), which is in turn a reliable method to monitor the insurgence and the development of diabetes mellitus. However, the engineering of naturally occurring FAOX to specifically recognize fructosyl-valine (the glycated N-terminal residue of HbA1c) has been hindered by the paucity of information on the tridimensional structures and catalytic residues of the different FAOX that exist in nature, and in general on the molecular mechanisms that regulate specificity in this class of enzymes. In this study, we use molecular dynamics simulations and advanced modeling techniques to investigate five different relevant wild-type FAOX (Amadoriase I, Amadoriase II, PnFPOX, FPOX-E and N1-1-FAOD) in order to elucidate the molecular mechanisms that drive their specificity towards polar and nonpolar substrates. Specifically, we compare these five different FAOX in terms of overall folding, ligand entry tunnels, ligand binding residues and ligand binding energies. Our work will contribute to future enzyme structure modifications aimed at the rational design of novel biosensors for the monitoring of blood glucose levels.. 2016\n",

            "Quantum spin Hall effect in rutile-based oxide multilayers. Dirac points in two-dimensional electronic structures are a source for topological electronic states due to the ±π Berry phase that they sustain. Here we show that two rutile multilayers [namely (WO2)2/(ZrO2)n and (PtO2)2/(ZrO2)n], where an active bilayer is sandwiched by a thick enough (n=6 is sufficient) band insulating substrate, show semimetallic Dirac dispersions with a total of four Dirac cones along the Γ-M direction. These become gapped upon the introduction of spin-orbit coupling, giving rise to an insulating ground state comprising four edge states. We discuss the origin of the lack of topological protection in terms of the valley spin-Chern numbers and the multiplicity of Dirac points. We show with a model Hamiltonian that mirror-symmetry breaking would be capable of creating a quantum phase transition to a strong topological insulator, with a single Kramers pair per edge.. 2016\n",
            "Mercury segregation and diselenide self-assembly on gold. We have investigated the self-assembly of didecyldiselenide on gold containing mercury using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry and infrared spectroscopy. The analysis of intensity and chemical shift of selected Se, Hg, and Au photoelectron lines on samples with increasing Hg content, show that didecyldiselenide adsorption strongly contributed to segregation of bulk Hg to the surface. The voltammetry results support this conclusion and suggest the formation of Hg-Au surface amalgam. The Hg surface segregation effect must be related to the restructuring of the surface following initial adsorption, and to the strong selenophilicity of Hg. The reflectance absorbance infrared spectroscopy studies show that the molecular layer on Hg-Au substrates lacks good order. © 2011 American Chemical Society.. 2012\n",

            "Adenylyl cyclase activating polypeptide reduces phosphorylation and toxicity of the polyglutamine-expanded androgen receptor in spinobulbar muscular atrophy. Spinobulbarmuscular atrophy (SBMA) is an X-linked neuromuscular disease caused by polyglutamine (polyQ) expansion in the androgen receptor (AR) gene. SBMA belongs to the family of polyQ diseases, which are fatal neurodegenerative disordersmainly caused by protein-mediated toxic gain-of-function mechanisms and characterized by deposition of misfolded proteins in the formof aggregates. The neurotoxicity of the polyQproteins can bemodified by phosphorylation at specific sites, thereby providing the rationale for the development of disease-specific treatments.We sought to identify signaling pathways thatmodulate polyQ-AR phosphorylation for therapy development.Wereport that cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) phosphorylates polyQ-AR specifically at Ser96. Phosphorylation of polyQ-AR by CDK2 increased protein stabilization and toxicity and is negatively regulated by the adenylyl cyclase (AC)/protein kinase A (PKA) signaling pathway. To translate these findings into therapy, we developed an analog of pituitary adenylyl cyclase activating polypeptide (PACAP), a potent activator of the AC/PKA pathway. Chronic intranasal administration of the PACAP analog to knock-in SBMA mice reduced Ser96 phosphorylation, promoted polyQ-AR degradation, and ameliorated disease outcome. These results provide proof of principle that noninvasive therapy based on the use of PACAP analogs is a therapeutic option for SBMA.. 2016\n",

            "Integrating force and position: testing model predictions. In this study, we investigated the integration of force and position information in a task in which participants were asked to estimate the center of a weak force field. Two hypotheses, describing how participants solved this task, were tested: (1) by only using the position(s) where the force reaches the detection threshold, and (2) by extrapolating the force field based on perceived stiffness. Both hypotheses were also described formally, assuming a psychophysical function obeying a power law with an exponent smaller than one. The hypotheses were tested in two psychophysical experiments, in which 12 participants took part. In Experiment 1, an asymmetric force field was used and the presence of visual feedback about hand position was varied. In Experiment 2, a unilateral force field was used. For both experiments, hypothesis 1 predicts biases between (Experiment 1) or at (Experiment 2) the position(s) of the force detection threshold, while hypothesis 2 predicts smaller biases. The measured data show significant biases in both experiments that coincide with the biases predicted by using force detection thresholds from the literature. The average measured responses and their variabilities also fitted very well with the mathematical model of hypothesis 1. These results underline the validity of hypothesis 1. So, participants did not use a percept of the stiffness of the force field, but based their estimation of the center of the force field on the position(s) where the force reached the detection threshold. This shows that force and position information were not integrated in this task.. 2016\n",
            "Transparent and flexible amorphous cellulose-acrylic hybrids. Amorphous cellulose and poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) blends in the form of free standing transparent hybrid films were prepared by dissolving both polymers in trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). Ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) measurements indicated that the transparency of the films was always maintained regardless of cellulose-PMMA proportions. In addition, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were carried out in order to characterize the chemical composition, intermolecular interactions and the crystallinity of the hybrid films. Thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA), differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) and tensile test measurements demonstrated that amorphous cellulose improved the thermal and mechanical properties of PMMA considerably. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements showed that hybrid films had no micron scale phase separation or segregation, resulting in highly uniform and homogenous miscibility between amorphous cellulose and PMMA. The wetting characteristics of the hybrid films were also studied by water contact angle measurements. Hybrid films showed better water barrier properties in comparison to commercial paper packaging. Furthermore, the hybrid films exhibited relative high dissolution resistance to common organic solvents, which dissolve PMMA completely. Considering the recent interest in polymer blends based on natural and synthetic macromolecules, these new transparent hybrids can have various potential applications particularly in general packaging and biomedical technologies.. 2016\n",

Rice husk ash is an important waste of agricultural industry that, within the framework of the circular economy, has been easily converted into a sustainable sorbent material. This was tested in this work for the pre-concentration of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS), representative perfluoroalkyl substances as probe environmental pollutants of waters, with HPLC-MS/MS quantification. The preparation involves a rapid microwave-assisted oxidation followed by a hydrothermal treatment, which was studied using a 22 design of experiments. The final material was thoroughly characterized and tested for its affinity to the target analytes by solid-phase extraction in environmental waters and wastewaters. Recoveries in the range 67–113 % (RSD < 11 %, n = 3) were achieved at environmentally relevant concentrations (10, 50, and 100 ng L-1) and the sorbent was reusable for at least ten consecutive extractions. Good linearity (R2 = 0.9997) was observed, with a method quantification limit in the water sample of 10 ng L-1 that allows the analysis of PFOA and PFOS below the established limits.

            "The case study of nesfatin-1 in the pancreas of tursiops truncatus. Nesfatin-1 (Nesf-1) is an anorexigenic peptide involved in the regulation of homeostatic feeding. Nesf-1 is expressed in the central nervous system and other organs, including pancreas, where it promotes the release of insulin from β-cells. This raises the possibility that Nesf-1 dysfunction could be involved in metabolic disorders, particularly in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D). Recently, it has been discovered that dolphins can be a natural animal model that fully replicates human T2D, due to its prolonged glucose tolerance curve and maintenance of a state of hyperglycemia similar to human T2D during fasting. This correspondence suggests that dolphins may be a suitable model for investigating physiological and pathological metabolic disorders. Here, we have characterized Nesf-1 distribution in the pancreas of the common bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) and measured plasmatic levels of Nesf-1 and glucose during fasting and post-prandial states. The Mediterranean Marine Mammal Tissue Bank (MMMTB) of the University of Padova provided us with pancreas samples, derived from four animals, and plasma samples, collected before and after the main meal. Interestingly, our results showed that Nesf-1-immunoreactive cells were distributed in Langerhans islets, co-localized with glucagon in α-cells. Similar to humans, dolphin plasma Nesf-1 concentration doesn't show a statistically significant difference when comparing fasting and post-prandial states. On the other hand, blood glucose levels were significantly higher before than after the main meal. Our data provide a comparative analysis for further studies on the involvement of Nesf-1 in mammalian metabolic disorders.. 2018\n",

            "Enteric Delivery of Regenerating Family Member 3 alpha Alters the Intestinal Microbiota and Controls Inflammation in Mice With Colitis. Background & Aims: Paneth cell dysfunction causes deficiencies in intestinal C-type lectins and antimicrobial peptides, which leads to dysbiosis of the intestinal microbiota, alters the mucosal barrier, and promotes development of inflammatory bowel diseases. We investigated whether transgenic (TG) expression of the human regenerating family member 3 alpha gene (REG3A) alters the fecal microbiota and affects development of colitis in mice. Methods: We performed studies with C57BL/6 mice that express human regenerating family member 3 alpha (hREG3A) in hepatocytes, via the albumin gene promoter. In these mice, hREG3A travels via the bile to the intestinal lumen. Some mice were given dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) to induce colitis. Feces were collected from mice and the composition of the microbiota was analyzed by 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing. The fecal microbiome was also analyzed from mice that express only 1 copy of human REG3A transgene but were fed feces from control mice (not expressing hREG3A) as newborns. Mice expressing hREG3A were monitored for DSS-induced colitis after cohousing or feeding feces from control mice. Colitis was induced in another set of control and hREG3A-TG mice by administration of trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid; some mice were given intrarectal injections of the hREG3A protein. Colon tissues were collected from mice and analyzed by histology and immunohistochemistry to detect mucin 2, as well as by 16S ribosomal RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization, transcriptional analyses, and quantitative polymerase chain reaction. We measured levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in bacterial cultures and fecal microbiota using 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate and flow cytometry. Results: The fecal microbiota of mice that express hREG3A had a significant shift in composition, compared with control mice, with enrichment of Clostridiales (Ruminococcaceae, Lachnospiraceae) and depletion of Bacteroidetes (Prevotellaceae); the TG mice developed less-severe colitis following administration of DSS than control mice, associated with preserved gut barrier integrity and reduced bacterial translocation, epithelial inflammation, and oxidative damage. A similar shift in the composition of the fecal microbiota occurred after a few months in TG mice heterozygous for REG3A that harbored a wild-type maternal microbiota at birth; these mice developed less-severe forms of colitis following DSS administration. Cohoused and germ-free mice fed feces from REG3A-TG mice and given DSS developed less-severe forms of colitis and had reduced lipopolysaccharide activation of the toll-like receptor 4 and increased survival times compared with mice not fed feces from REG3A-TG mice. REG3A TG mice developed only mild colonic inflammation after exposure to 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid, compared with control mice. Control mice given intrarectal hREG3A and exposed to 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid showed less colon damage and inflammation than mice not given intrarectal hREG3A. Fecal samples from REG3A-TG mice had lower levels of ROS than feces from control mice during DSS administration. Addition of hREG3A to bacterial cultures reduced levels of ROS and increased survival of oxygen-sensitive commensal bacteria (Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and Roseburia intestinalis). Conclusions: Mice with hepatocytes that express hREG3A, which travels to the intestinal lumen, are less sensitive to colitis than control mice. We found hREG3A to alter the colonic microbiota by decreasing levels of ROS. Fecal microbiota from REG3A-TG mice protect non-TG mice from induction of colitis. These findings indicate a role for reduction of oxidative stress in preserving the gut microbiota and its ability to prevent inflammation.. 2018\n",

            "Mineralogical, crystallographic and redox features of the earliest stages of fluid alteration in CM chondrites. The CM chondrites represent the largest group of hydrated meteorites and span a wide range of conditions, from less altered (i.e., CM2) down to heavily altered (i.e., CM1). The Paris chondrite is considered the least altered CM and thus enables the earliest stages of aqueous alteration processes to be deciphered. Here, we report results from a nanoscale study of tochilinite/cronstedtite intergrowths (TCIs) in Paris—TCIs being the emblematic secondary mineral assemblages of CM chondrites, formed from the alteration of Fe-Ni metal beads (type-I TCIs) and anhydrous silicates (type-II TCIs). We combined high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, scanning transmission X-ray microscopy and electron diffraction tomography to characterize the crystal structure, crystal chemistry and redox state of TCIs. The data obtained are useful to reconstruct the alteration conditions of Paris and to compare them with those of other meteorites. Our results show that tochilinite in Paris is characterized by a high hydroxide layer content (n = 2.1–2.2) regardless of the silicate precursors. When examined alongside other CMs, it appears that the hydroxide layer and iron contents of tochilinites correlate with the degree of alteration experienced by the chondrites. The Fe3+/ΣFe ratios of TCIs are high: 8–15% in tochilinite, 33–60% in cronstedtite and 70–80% in hydroxides. These observations suggest that alteration of CM chondrites took place under oxidizing conditions that could have been induced by significant H2 release during serpentinization. Similar results were recently reported in CR chondrites (Le Guillou et al., 2015), suggesting that the process(es) controlling the redox state of the secondary mineral assemblages were quite similar in the CM and CR parent bodies despite the different alteration conditions. According to our mineralogical and crystallographic survey, the formation of TCIs in Paris occurred at temperatures lower than 100 °C, under neutral, slightly alkaline conditions that favored the formation of both tochilinite and cronstedtite. During the course of alteration, the reduction in sulfur activity and/or the decrease of temperature prevented tochilinite crystallization and favoured the formation of cronstedtite and iron hydroxides. We suggest that iron hydroxides probably formed as ferrihydrite and then progressively converted to goethite between 50° and 80 °C, a temperature range that is also favorable for cronstedtite formation. The presence of cronstedtite plays a key role in the reconstruction of the alteration history, demonstrating that the alteration of Paris took place by way of serpentinization processes similar to those described on the Earth.. 2017\n",

            "Object identification from few examples by improving the invariance of a deep convolutional neural network. The development of reliable and robust visual recognition systems is a main challenge towards the deployment of autonomous robotic agents in unconstrained environments. Learning to recognize objects requires image representations that are discriminative to relevant information while being invariant to nuisances, such as scaling, rotations, light and background changes, and so forth. Deep Convolutional Neural Networks can learn such representations from large webcollected image datasets and a natural question is how these systems can be best adapted to the robotics context where little supervision is often available. In this work, we investigate different training strategies for deep architectures on a new dataset collected in a real-world robotic setting.

            "Design and fabrication by thermal imprint lithography and mechanical characterization of a ring-based PDMS soft probe for sensing and actuating forces in biological systems. In this paper, the design, fabrication and mechanical characterization of a novel polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) soft probe for delivering and sensing forces in biological systems is proposed. On the basis of preliminary finite element (FEM) analysis, the design takes advantage of a suitable core geometry, characterized by a variable spring-like ring. The compliance of probes can be finely set in a wide range to measure forces in the micronewton to nanonewton range. In particular, this is accomplished by properly resizing the ring geometry and/or exploiting the mixing ratio-based elastic properties of PDMS. Fabrication by the thermal imprint lithography method allows fast and accurate tuning of ring sizes and tailoring of the contact section to their targets. By only varying geometrical parameters, the stiffness ranges from 1080 mNm-1 to 50 mNm-1, but by changing the base-curing agent proportion of the elastomer from 10:1 to 30:1, the stiffness drops to 37 mNm-1. With these compliances, the proposed device will provide a new experimental tool for investigating force-dependent biological functions in sensory systems.. 2019\n",
            "Optical trapping studies of colloidal interactions in liquid films. A tightly focused light beam can stably trap small objects in three dimensions. Using spatial light modulators we can engineer the wavefront of a laser beam in such a way that, once focused by a microscope objective, it produces an almost arbitrary light intensity distribution. Arrays of optical traps can be thus generated in three-dimensional space and dynamically reconfigured. Optical traps allow direct manipulation and sensing on those length and energy scale that are most relevant in many colloidal processes. In the presence of long range interactions optical traps actually provide a unique tool of direct investigation allowing the precise relative positioning of particle pairs, far from boundaries or other particles. We have used optical trapping to directly measure two very long range interactions governing colloidal dynamics in two-dimensional fluid films: hydrodynamic interactions, which are found to decay logarithmically slow with distance, and capillary forces, whose intensity decreases as a power law with an exponent slightly smaller than one. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

ConspectusFollowing the impressive development of bulk lead-based perovskite photovoltaics, the \"perovskite fever\"did not spare nanochemistry. In just a few years, colloidal cesium lead halide perovskite nanocrystals have conquered researchers worldwide with their easy synthesis and color-pure photoluminescence. These nanomaterials promise cheap solution-processed lasers, scintillators, and light-emitting diodes of record brightness and efficiency. However, that promise is threatened by poor stability and unwanted reactivity issues, throwing down the gauntlet to chemists.More generally, Cs-Pb-X nanocrystals have opened an exciting chapter in the chemistry of colloidal nanocrystals, because their ionic nature and broad diversity have challenged many paradigms established by nanocrystals of long-studied metal chalcogenides, pnictides, and oxides. The chemistry of colloidal Cs-Pb-X nanocrystals is synonymous with change: These materials demonstrate an intricate pattern of shapes and compositions and readily transform under physical stimuli or the action of chemical agents. In this Account, we walk through four types of Cs-Pb-X nanocrystal metamorphoses: Change of structure, color, shape, and surface. These transformations are often interconnected; for example, a change in shape may also entail a change of color.The ionic bonding, high anion mobility due to vacancies, and preservation of cationic substructure in the Cs-Pb-X compounds enable fast anion exchange reactions, allowing the precise control of the halide composition of nanocrystals of perovskites and related compounds (e.g., CsPbCl3 â‡., CsPbBr3 â‡., CsPbI3 and Cs4PbCl6 â‡., Cs4PbBr6 â‡., Cs4PbI6) and tuning of their absorption edge and bright photoluminescence across the visible spectrum. Ion exchanges, however, are just one aspect of a richer chemistry.Cs-Pb-X nanocrystals are able to capture or release (in short, trade) ions or even neutral species from or to the surrounding environment, causing major changes to their structure and properties. The trade of neutral PbX2 units allows Cs-Pb-X nanocrystals to cross the boundaries among four different types of compounds: 4CsX + PbX2 â‡., Cs4PbBr6 + 3PbX2 â‡., 4CsPbBr3 + PbX2 â‡., 4CsPb2X5. These reactions do not occur at random, because the reactant and product nanocrystals are connected by the Cs+ cation substructure preservation principle, stating that ion trade reactions can transform one compound into another by means of distorting, expanding, or contracting their shared Cs+ cation substructure.The nanocrystal surface is a boundary between the core and the surrounding environment of Cs-Pb-X nanocrystals. The surface influences nanocrystal stability, optical properties, and shape. For these reasons, the dynamic surface of Cs-Pb-X nanocrystals has been studied in detail, especially in CsPbX3 perovskites. Two takeaways have emerged from these studies. First, the competition between primary alkylammonium and cesium cations for the surface sites during the CsPbX3 nanocrystal nucleation and growth governs the cube/plate shape equilibrium. Short-chain acids and branched amines influence that equilibrium and enable shape-shifting synthesis of pure CsPbX3 cubes, nanoplatelets, nanosheets, or nanowires. Second, quaternary ammonium halides are emerging as superior ligands that extend the shelf life of Cs-Pb-X colloidal nanomaterials, boost their photoluminescence quantum yield, and prevent foreign ions from escaping the nanocrystals. That is accomplished by combining reduced ligand solubility, due to the branched organic ammonium cation, with the surface-healing capabilities of the halide counterions, which are small Lewis bases.. 2021\n",

            "A 4-DoF wearable hand device for haptic rendering of surfaces and edges. We present a 4-degrees-of-freedom (4-DoF) wearable haptic device for the palm, able to provide the sensation of interacting with slanted surfaces and edges. It is composed of a static upper body, secured to the back of the hand, and a mobile end-effector, placed in contact with the palm. They are connected by two articulated arms, actuated by four servo motors housed on the upper body and along the arms. The end-effector is a foldable flat surface that can make/break contact with the palm to provide pressure feedback, move sideways to provide skin stretch and tangential motion feedback, and fold to elicit the sensation of interacting with different curvatures. The paper presents the design of the wearable haptic device, together with its mobility, statics, and manipulability, as well as direct, inverse, and differential kinematics. We also present a position control scheme for the device, which is then quantitatively evaluated.. 2024\n",
            "Plasmonic Photochemistry as a Tool to Prepare Metallic Nanopores with Controlled Diameter for Optimized Detection of Single Entities. Plasmonic solid-state nanopores with tunable hole diameters can be prepared via a photocatalytic effect resulting from the enhanced electromagnetic (EM) field inside a metallic ring on top of a dielectric nanotube. Under white light illumination, the plasmon-enhanced EM-field induces a site-selective metal nucleation and growth within the ring. This approach is used to prepare Au and bimetallic Au–Ag nano-rings and demonstrate the reduction of the initial inner diameter of the nanopore down to 4 nm. The tunability of the nanopore diameter can be used to enable optimized detection of single entities with different sizes. As a proof-of-concept, single object detection of double stranded DNA (dsDNA) and Au nanoparticles (AuNPs) with a diameter down to 15 nm is performed. Numerical simulations provide insights into the EM-field distribution and confinement, showing that a field intensity enhancement of up to 104 can be achieved inside the nanopores. This localized EM-field can be used to perform enhanced optical measurements and generate local heating, thereby modifying the properties of the nanopore. Such a flexible approach also represents a valuable tool to investigate plasmon-driven photochemical reactions, and it can represent an important step toward the realization of new plasmonic devices.. 2023\n",
            "High-resolution low-frequency Raman spectra of liquid H2O and D2O. New high-resolution experimental data on the low-frequency Raman spectrum of water and heavy water are presented. Both polarized and depolarized spectra are studied over a wide temperature range, including the supercooled liquid region. For the first time the absolute Raman cross section of the depolarized spectrum is reported to be ≈2x10-3 Å6/molecule, for both liquids within the experimental error at room temperature, and compared with the integrated intensity of the Brillouin doublet, 0.134 Å6/molecule. The analysis of the temperature behavior of both integrated intensity and line shapes, and the comparison with the results of molecular dynamics simulations indicate that the Raman spectra in the 0-50 cm-1 region are dominated by the dipole-induced dipole contribution.

Lead halide perovskites (LHPs) in the form of nanometre-sized colloidal crystals, or nanocrystals (NCs), have attracted the attention of diverse materials scientists due to their unique optical versatility, high photoluminescence quantum yields and facile synthesis. LHP NCs have a 'soft' and predominantly ionic lattice, and their optical and electronic properties are highly tolerant to structural defects and surface states. Therefore, they cannot be approached with the same experimental mindset and theoretical framework as conventional semiconductor NCs.

            "Online motion synthesis with minimal intervention control and formal safety guarantees. We present a framework for online coordinated obstacle avoidance with formal safety guarantees. Such a formally verified trajectory planner can be used in shared human-robot workspaces to guarantee safety. The obstacle avoidance is based on estimation of the human occupancy on two different time scales. A long-term plan is created based on a probabilistic task representation, learned by demonstration, and an estimate of the human occupancy to be avoided. Using an additional overapproximative, short-term prediction of human motion we guarantee that the robot can always account for sudden or reflex movements. We demonstrate our two-level obstacle avoidance in simulation. The results show that our method reduces the number of safety stops one would encounter when using only the formal safety verification, and synthesizes alternative movement plans that preserves the coordination observed in the original demonstrations.. 2017\n",

            "Two-Color Emitting Colloidal Nanocrystals as Single-Particle Ratiometric Probes of Intracellular pH. Intracellular pH is a key parameter in many biological mechanisms and cell metabolism and is used to detect and monitor cancer formation and brain or heart diseases. pH-sensing is typically performed by fluorescence microscopy using pH-responsive dyes. Accuracy is limited by the need for quantifying the absolute emission intensity in living biological samples. An alternative with a higher sensitivity and precision uses probes with a ratiometric response arising from the different pH-sensitivity of two emission channels of a single emitter. Current ratiometric probes are complex constructs suffering from instability and cross-readout due to their broad emission spectra. Here, we overcome such limitations using a single-particle ratiometric pH probe based on dot-in-bulk CdSe/CdS nanocrystals (NCs). These nanostructures feature two fully-separated narrow emissions with different pH sensitivity arising from radiative recombination of core- and shell-localized excitons. The core emission is nearly independent of the pH, whereas the shell luminescence increases in the 3–11 pH range, resulting in a cross-readout-free ratiometric response as strong as 600%. In vitro microscopy demonstrates that the ratiometric response in biologic media resembles the precalibralation curve obtained through far-field titration experiments. The NCs show good biocompatibility, enabling us to monitor in real-time the pH in living cells.. 2017\n",
            "The Extended Mirror Neuron Network: Anatomy, Origin, and Functions. Mirror neurons (MNs) are a fascinating class of cells originally discovered in the ventral premotor cortex (PMv) and, subsequently, in the inferior parietal lobule (IPL) of the macaque, which become active during both the execution and observation of actions. In this review, I will first highlight the mounting evidence indicating that mirroring others' actions engages a broad system of reciprocally connected cortical areas, which extends well beyond the classical IPL-PMv circuit and might even include subcortical regions such as the basal ganglia. Then, I will present the most recent findings supporting the idea that the observation of one's own actions, which might play a role in the ontogenetic origin and tuning of MNs, retains a particular relevance within the adult MN system. Finally, I will propose that both cortical and subcortical mechanisms do exist to decouple MN activity from the motor output, in order to render it exploitable for high-order perceptual, cognitive, and even social functions. The findings reviewed here provide an original framework for envisaging the main challenges and experimental directions of future neurophysiological and neuroanatomical studies of the monkey MN system.. 2017\n",
            "Knowing me, knowing you: Resting-state functional connectivity of ventromedial prefrontal cortex dissociates memory related to self from a familiar other. Material related to the self, as well as to significant others, often displays mnemonic superiority through its associations with highly organised and elaborate representations. Neuroimaging studies suggest this effect is related to activation in regions of medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Incidental memory scores for trait adjectives, processed in relation to the self, a good friend and David Cameron were collected. Scores for each referent were used as regressors in seed-based analyses of resting state fMRI data performed in ventral, middle and dorsal mPFC seeds, as well as hippocampal formation. Stronger memory for self-processed items was predicted by functional connnectivity between ventral mPFC, angular gyrus and middle temporal gyri. These regions are within the default mode network, linked to relatively automatic aspects of memory retrieval. In contrast, memory for items processed in relation to best friends, was better in individuals whose ventral mPFC showed relatively weak connectivity with paracingulate gyrus as well as positive connectivity with lateral prefrontal and parietal regions associated with controlled retrieval. These results suggest that mechanisms responsible for memory related to ourselves and personally-familiar people are partially dissociable and reflect connections between ventral mPFC, implicated in schema-based memory, and regions implicated in more automatic and controlled aspects of retrieval.. 2017\n",
            "Who will you imitate? Studying reciprocal influence in children-robot groups during an imitation game. This work aims to advance the understanding of group dynamics in robot-child interactions, focusing on whether, during a motor-imitation task led by a Nao robot, children might be influenced in their action executions by other group members - human or robotic. After testing eighteen groups of four children and teenagers, our findings indicate that participants tend to disregard the robot when it performs atypical gestures, preferring instead to imitate the actions of a human peer. Moreover, we found evidence that, in this scenario, assigning a leadership role to the robot does not, by itself, guarantee compliance from human group members; broader group dynamics must also be taken into account. Further results show that participants are significantly more likely to imitate the robot’s action when the “proactive” group members (i.e., those who initiate actions first) conform to Nao, compared to when they do not. Previous studies suggest that the mutual influence of group members can facilitate interaction with a robotic agent; however, our findings show that the presence of proactive members could also undermine the group’s conformity to the robot. Additionally, these findings highlight the importance of personalizing robots to better integrate into specific group dynamics, enhancing their ability to influence different groups effectively.. 2025\n",

            "Fluorescence enhancement in colloidal semiconductor nanocrystals by metallic nanopatterns. In this work we demonstrate the possibility of obtaining a significant increase of the photoluminescence of colloidal semiconductor nanocrystals (NCs) by means of metallic nanopatterns. Highly ordered triangular-shaped gold nanopatterns (typical dimensions 200 nm) were fabricated on planar substrates by electron beam lithography (EBL). Colloidal semiconductor nanocrystals (core/shell CdSe/ZnS quantum dots or CdSe nanorods) dispersed in a polymer matrix (PMMA) were subsequently deposited on the substrates by spin-coating. The coupling between the surface plasmons (SPs) resonance band of the metallic nanostructures and the excitation/emission bands of the nanocrystals resulted in a strong enhancement of the fluorescence from the quantum emitters, as probed by confocal microscopy analyses. Importantly, the proposed approach allows a precise control of the shape and dimensions of the single metallic nanostructure (and consequently of the SPs resonances), thanks to the nanometer resolution of the EBL. Moreover, the concentration of the NCs dispersed in the blend, as well as the thickness of the active layer, can be finely tuned. These results may open interesting perspectives for a wide range of applications, such as photonic devices, LEDs, sensor technology, microarrays, single/few molecules experiments, and biochemical/biophysical investigations. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Back-support exoskeletons are commonly used in the workplace to reduce low back pain risk for workers performing demanding activities. However, for the assistance of tasks differing from lifting, back-support exoskeletons potential has not been exploited extensively. This work focuses on the use of an active back-support exoskeleton to assist carrying. A control strategy is designed that modulates the exoskeleton torques to comply with the task assistance requirements. In particular, two gait phase detection frameworks are exploited to adapt the exoskeleton assistance according to the legs' motion. The control strategy is assessed through an experimental analysis on ten subjects. Carrying task is performed without and with the exoskeleton assistance. Results prove the potential of the presented control in assisting the task without hindering the gait movement and improving the usability experienced by users. Moreover, the exoskeleton assistance significantly reduces the lumbar load associated with the task, demonstrating its promising use for risk mitigation in the workplace.. 2023\n",

Since 2014 the layered semiconductor SnSe in the high-temperature Cmcm phase is known to be the most efficient intrinsic thermoelectric material. Making use of first-principles calculations we show that its vibrational and thermal transport properties are determined by huge nonperturbative anharmonic effects. We show that the transition from the Cmcm phase to the low-symmetry Pnma is a second-order phase transition driven by the collapse of a zone border phonon, whose frequency vanishes at the transition temperature. Our calculations show that the spectral function of the in-plane vibrational modes are strongly anomalous with shoulders and double-peak structures. We calculate the lattice thermal conductivity obtaining good agreement with experiments only when nonperturbative anharmonic scattering is included. Our results suggest that the good thermoelectric efficiency of SnSe is strongly affected by the nonperturbative anharmonicity.. 2019\n",

Hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites (PVKs) are among the most promising materials for optoelectronic applications thanks to their outstanding photophysical properties and easy synthesis. Herein, a new PVK-based thermochromic composite is demonstrated. It can reversibly switch from a transparent state (transmittance > 80%) at room temperature to a coloured state (transmittance < 10%) at high temperature, with very fast kinetics, taking only a few seconds to go from the bleached to the colored state (and vice versa).X-ray diffraction, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, Differential Scanning Calometry, rheological and optical measurements carried out during heating/cooling cycles reveal that thermochromism in our material is based on a reversible process of PVK disassembly/assembly mediated by intercalating polymeric chains, through the formation and breaking of hydrogen bonds between polymer and perovskite. Therefore, differently from other thermochromic perovskites, that generally work with the adsorption/desorption of volatile molecules, our system is able to perform several heating/cooling cycles regardless of environmental conditions.The color and transition temperature (from 70 to 120°C) can be tuned depending on the type of perovskite.Moreover, this thermochromic material is printable and can be deposited by cheap techniques, paving the way for a new class of smart coatings with an unprecedented range of colors.. 2023\n",

            "The kinetics of p53-binding and histone acetylation at target promoters do not strictly correlate with gene expression after UV damage. We have addressed the correlation between sequence-specific DNA binding by the tumor suppressor p53 and transactivation of various target genes, in the context of UV irradiation responses. In A549 cells (p53WT), p53 occupancy at the p21, mdm2, and puma promoters increased significantly after UV irradiation. In contrast, p21 mRNA levels did not change, mdm2 mRNA decreased and both p21 and mdm2 proteins were down regulated shortly after UV. At later times, higher p53 occupancy correlated with enhanced expression of these two genes both at mRNA and protein levels. In the p53 mutant cell lines LX1 (R273H) and SKMes1 (R280K), no significant p53-binding was detected at the gene targets analyzed. Accordingly, p21 and mdm2 proteins were not upregulated after UV irradiation. The kinetics of histone acetylation did not strictly correlate with gene expression. In fact, high levels of acetylated H3 (AcH3) and, particularly, acetylated H4 (AcH4) histones were found shortly after UV irradiation on p21 and mdm2 promoters. At the later time point, when transactivation was detected, acetylation levels decreased significantly although remaining higher than basal levels. Our results indicate that p53 transcription-dependent and -independent responses are activated with different kinetics after UV, possibly relating to the repair of UV-induced DNA damage. Based on the histone acetylation pattern we hypothesize that the DNA repair function of p53, associated to global genome repair and foci of DNA damage, may be relevant for all p53-binding sites, including those where occupancy by p53 is also associated to transcriptional modulation. © 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.. 2007\n",

            "Relation between palm and finger cortical representations in primary somatosensory cortex: A 7T fMRI study. Many studies focused on the cortical representations of fingers, while the palm is relatively neglected despite its importance for hand function. Here, we investigated palm representation (PR) and its relationship with finger representations (FRs) in primary somatosensory cortex (S1). Few studies in humans suggested that PR is located medially with respect to FRs in S1, yet to date, no study directly quantified the somatotopic organization of PR and the five FRs. Importantly, the link between the somatotopic organization of PR and FRs and their activation properties remains largely unexplored. Using 7T fMRI, we mapped PR and the five FRs at the single subject level. First, we analyzed the cortical distance between PR and FRs to determine their somatotopic organization. Results show that PR was located medially with respect to D5. Second, we tested whether the observed cortical distances would predict the relationship between PR and FRs activations. Using three complementary measures (cross-activations, pattern similarity and resting-state connectivity), we show that the relationship between PR and FRs activations were not determined by their somatotopic organization, that is, there was no gradient moving from D5 to D1, except for resting-state connectivity, which was predicted by the somatotopy. Instead, we show that the representational geometry of PR and FRs activations reflected the physical structure of the hand. Collectively, our findings suggest that the spatial proximity between topographically organized neuronal populations do not necessarily predicts their functional properties, rather the structure of the sensory space (e.g., the hand shape) better describes the observed results.. 2021\n",
            "Towards Equivariant Optical Flow Estimation with Deep Learning. Methods for Optical Flow (OF) estimation based on Deep Learning have considerably improved traditional approaches in challenging and realistic conditions. However, data-driven approaches can inherently be biased, leading to unexpected under-performance in real application scenarios. In this paper, we first observe that the OF estimation accuracy varies with motion direction, and name this phenomenon 'OF sign imbalance'. The sign imbalance cannot be assessed by means of the endpoint-error (EPE), the typical training and evaluation metric for Deep Optical Flow estimators. This paper tackles this issue by proposing a new metric to assess the sign imbalance, which is compared to the endpoint-error. We provide an extensive evaluation of the sign imbalance for the state-of-the-art optical flow estimators. Based on the evaluation, we propose two strategies to mitigate the phenomenon, i) by constraining the model estimations during inference, and, ii) by constraining the loss function during training.

Re-identification systems aim at recognizing the same individuals in multiple cameras and one of the most relevant problems is that the appearance of same individual varies across cameras due to illumination and viewpoint changes. This paper proposes the use of Cumulative Weighted Brightness Transfer Functions to model this appearance variations. It is multiple frame-based learning approach which leverages consecutive detections of each individual to transfer the appearance, rather than learning brightness transfer function from pairs of images. We tested our approach on standard multi-camera surveillance datasets showing consistent and significant improvements over existing methods on three different datasets without any other additional cost. Our approach is general and can be applied to any appearance-based method.. 2015\n",

In this paper, we introduce a control algorithm based on the delayed feedback control method to stabilize a fractional order system on an unstable fixed point. The control input is defined as the difference between the future, and current state. The gain matrix is obtained using the pole placement method. To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, we give simulation results of the control of fractional chaotic Chua's system. © 2008 IEEE.. 2008\n",
            "Enhancing the Performance of CdSe/CdS Dot-in-Rod Light-Emitting Diodes via Surface Ligand Modification. The surface ligands on colloidal nanocrystals (NCs) play an important role in the performance of NC-based optoelectronic devices such as photovoltaic cells, photodetectors, and light-emitting diodes (LEDs). On one hand, the NC emission depends critically on the passivation of the surface to minimize trap states that can provide nonradiative recombination channels. On the other hand, the electrical properties of NC films are dominated by the ligands that constitute the barriers for charge transport from one NC to its neighbor. Therefore, surface modifications via ligand exchange have been employed to improve the conductance of NC films. However, in LEDs, such surface modifications are more critical because of their possible detrimental effects on the emission properties. In this work, we study the role of surface ligand modifications on the optical and electrical properties of CdSe/CdS dot-in-rods (DiRs) in films and investigate their performance in all-solution-processed LEDs. The DiR films maintain high photoluminescence quantum yield, around 40-50%, and their electroluminescence in the LED preserves the excellent color purity of the photoluminescence. In the LEDs, the ligand exchange boosted the luminance, reaching a fourfold increase from 2200 cd/m2 for native surfactants to 8500 cd/m2 for the exchanged aminoethanethiol (AET) ligands. Moreover, the efficiency roll-off, operational stability, and shelf life are significantly improved, and the external quantum efficiency is modestly increased from 5.1 to 5.4%. We relate these improvements to the increased conductivity of the emissive layer and to the better charge balance of the electrically injected carriers. In this respect, we performed ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) to obtain a deeper insight into the band alignment of the LED structure. The UPS data confirm similar flat-band offsets of the emitting layer to the electron- and hole-transport layers in the case of AET ligands, which translates to more symmetric barriers for charge injection of electrons and holes. Furthermore, the change in solubility of the NCs induced by the ligand exchange allows for a layer-by-layer deposition process of the DiR films, which yields excellent homogeneity and good thickness control and enables the fabrication of all the LED layers (except for cathode and anode) by spin-coating.. 2018\n",
            "Design of the Hydraulically Actuated, Torque-Controlled Quadruped Robot HyQ2Max. This paper presents the design of the hydraulically actuated quadruped robot HyQ2Max. HyQ2Max is an evolution of the 80 kg agile and versatile robot HyQ. Compared to HyQ, the new robot needs to be more rugged, more powerful and extend the existing locomotion skills with self-righting capability. Since the robot's actuation system has an impact on many aspects of the overall design/specifications of the robot (e.g., payload, speed, torque, overall mass, and compactness), this paper will pay special attention to the selection and sizing of the joint actuators. To obtain meaningful joint requirements for the new machine, we simulated seven characteristic motions that cover a wide range of required behaviors of an agile rough terrain robot, including trotting on rough terrain, stair climbing, push recovery, self-righting, etc. We will describe how to use the obtained joint requirements for the selection of the hydraulic actuator types, four-bar linkage parameters, and valve size. Poorly sized actuators may lead to limited robot capabilities or higher cost, weight, energy consumption, and cooling requirements. The main contributions of this paper are: 1) a novel design of an agile quadruped robot capable of performing trotting/crawling over flat/uneven terrain, balancing, and self-righting; 2) a detailed method to find suitable hydraulic cylinder/valve properties and linkage parameters with a specific focus on optimizing the actuator areas; and 3) to the best knowledge of the authors, the most complete review of hydraulic quadruped robots.. 2017\n",
            "Design and characterization of a human monoclonal antibody that modulates mutant connexin 26 hemichannels implicated in deafness and skin disorders. Background: Mutations leading to changes in properties, regulation, or expression of connexin-made channels have been implicated in 28 distinct human hereditary diseases. Eight of these result from variants of connexin 26 (Cx26), a protein critically involved in cell-cell signaling in the inner ear and skin. Lack of non-toxic drugs with defined mechanisms of action poses a serious obstacle to therapeutic interventions for diseases caused by mutant connexins. In particular, molecules that specifically modulate connexin hemichannel function without affecting gap junction channels are considered of primary importance for the study of connexin hemichannel role in physiological as well as pathological conditions. Monoclonal antibodies developed in the last three decades have become the most important class of therapeutic biologicals. Recombinant methods permit rapid selection and improvement of monoclonal antibodies from libraries with large diversity. Methods: By screening a combinatorial library of human single-chain fragment variable (scFv) antibodies expressed in phage, we identified a candidate that binds an extracellular epitope of Cx26. We characterized antibody action using a variety of biochemical and biophysical assays in HeLa cells, organotypic cultures of mouse cochlea and human keratinocyte-derived cells. Results: We determined that the antibody is a remarkably efficient, non-toxic, and completely reversible inhibitor of hemichannels formed by connexin 26 and does not affect direct cell-cell communication via gap junction channels. Importantly, we also demonstrate that the antibody efficiently inhibits hyperative mutant Cx26 hemichannels implicated in autosomal dominant non-syndromic hearing impairment accompanied by keratitis and hystrix-like ichthyosis-deafness (KID/HID) syndrome. We solved the crystal structure of the antibody, identified residues that are critical for binding and used molecular dynamics to uncover its mechanism of action. Conclusions: Although further studies will be necessary to validate the effect of the antibody in vivo, the methodology described here can be extended to select antibodies against hemichannels composed by other connexin isoforms and, consequently, to target other pathologies associated with hyperactive hemichannels. Our study highlights the potential of this approach and identifies connexins as therapeutic targets addressable by screening phage display libraries expressing human randomized antibodies.. 2017\n",
            "New insights on amorphous silicon-nitride microcavities. All amorphous silicon-nitride planar optical microcavities operating in the visible range have been grown by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition. The luminescence intensity of the N-rich silicon-nitride layer from a microcavity with 6 period distributed Bragg reflectors (DBRs) is two order of magnitude higher than that of the luminescent layer without the cavity. Moreover, a strong directionality of the microcavities emission can be observed. Such results can be ascribed to the anisotropic optical density of states induced in the Fabry-Perot structure. The quality factors of the resonators are strictly correlated to the number of periods of the DBRs. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.. 2003\n",

The proposed experimental set-up allows connecting the brain of freely moving rats to an external device. We tested this apparatus in a preliminary experiment with an alert rat that used the interface for acquiring a food reward.

            "Osteogenic and angiogenic tissue formation in high fidelity nanocomposite Laponite-gelatin bioinks. Bioprinting of living cells is rapidly developing as an advanced biofabrication approach to engineer tissues. Bioinks can be extruded in three-dimensions (3D) to fabricate complex and hierarchical constructs for implantation. However, a lack of functionality can often be attributed to poor bioink properties. Indeed, advanced bioinks encapsulating living cells should: (i) present optimal rheological properties and retain 3D structure post fabrication, (ii) promote cell viability and support cell differentiation, and (iii) localise proteins of interest (e.g. vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)) to stimulate encapsulated cell activity and tissue ingrowth upon implantation. In this study, we present the results of the inclusion of a synthetic nanoclay, Laponite® (LPN) together with a gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) bioink and the development of a functional cell-instructive bioink. A nanocomposite bioink displaying enhanced shape fidelity retention and interconnected porosity within extrusion-bioprinted fibres was observed. Human bone marrow stromal cell (HBMSC) viability within the nanocomposite showed no significant changes over 21 days of culture in LPN-GelMA (85.60 ± 10.27%), compared to a significant decrease in GelMA from 7 (95.88 ± 2.90%) to 21 days (55.54 ± 14.72%) (p < 0.01). HBMSCs were observed to proliferate in LPN-GelMA with a significant increase in cell number over 21 days (p < 0.0001) compared to GelMA alone. HBMSC-laden LPN-GelMA scaffolds supported osteogenic differentiation evidenced by mineralised nodule formation, including in the absence of the osteogenic drug dexamethasone. Ex vivo implantation in a chick chorioallantoic membrane model, demonstrated excellent integration of the bioink constructs in the vascular chick embryo after 7 days of incubation. VEGF-loaded LPN-GelMA constructs demonstrated significantly higher vessel penetration than GelMA-VEGF (p < 0.0001) scaffolds. Integration and vascularisation was directly related to increased drug absorption and retention by LPN-GelMA compared to LPN-free GelMA. In summary, a novel light-curable nanocomposite bioink for 3D skeletal regeneration supportive of cell growth and growth factor retention and delivery, evidenced by ex vivo vasculogenesis, was developed with potential application in hard and soft tissue reparation.. 2019\n",
            "Recent advances in dynamic docking for drug discovery. Molecular docking allows the evaluation of ligand-target complementarity. This is the crucial first step in small-molecule drug discovery. Over the last decade, increasing computer power and more efficient molecular dynamics (MD) software have prompted the use of MD for molecular docking. The resulting dynamic docking offers major improvements by (1) taking full account of the structural flexibility of the drug-target system and (2) allowing the computation of the free energy and kinetics associated with drug binding. Here, we examine the recent advances in dynamic docking, while also considering the challenges and limitations that this powerful approach must overcome to impact fast-paced drug discovery.

            "Enhancing four-wave-mixing processes by nanowire arrays coupled to a gold film. We consider the process of four-wave mixing in an array of gold nanowires strongly coupled to a gold film. Using full-wave simulations, we perform a quantitative comparison of the four-wave mixing efficiency associated with a bare film and films with nanowire arrays. We find that the strongly localized surface plasmon resonances of the coupled nanowires provide an additional local field enhancement that, along with the delocalized surface plasmon of the film, produces an overall four-wave mixing efficiency enhancement of up to six orders of magnitude over that of the bare film. The enhancement occurs over a wide range of excitation angles. The film-coupled nanowire array is easily amenable to nanofabrication, and could find application as an ultra-compact component for integrated photonic and quantum optic systems. © 2012 Optical Society of America.. 2012\n",

            "Monoglyceride lipase: Structure and inhibitors. Monoglyceride lipase (MGL), the main enzyme responsible for the hydrolytic deactivation of the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycerol (2-AG), is an intracellular serine hydrolase that plays critical roles in many physiological and pathological processes, such as pain, inflammation, neuroprotection and cancer. The crystal structures of MGL that are currently available provide valuable information about how this enzyme might function and interact with site-directed small-molecule inhibitors. On the other hand, its conformational equilibria and the contribution of regulatory cysteine residues present within the substrate-binding pocket or on protein surface remain open issues. Several classes of MGL inhibitors have been developed, from early reversible ones, such as URB602 and pristimerin, to carbamoylating agents that react with the catalytic serine, such as JZL184 and more recent O-hexafluoroisopropyl carbamates. Other inhibitors that modulate MGL activity by interacting with conserved regulatory cysteines act through mechanisms that deserve to be more thoroughly investigated.. 2016\n",

            "Gold-nanoparticles coated with the antimicrobial peptide esculentin-1a(1-21)NH2 as a reliable strategy for antipseudomonal drugs. Naturally occurring antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) hold promise as future therapeutics against multidrug resistant microorganisms. Recently, we have discovered that a derivative of the frog skin AMP esculentin-1a, Esc(1-21), is highly potent against both free living and biofilm forms of the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. However, bringing AMPs into clinics requires to overcome their low stability, high toxicity and inefficient delivery to the target site at high concentrations. Importantly, peptide conjugation to gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), which are among the most applied inorganic nanocarriers in biomedical sciences, represents a valuable strategy to solve these problems. Here we report that covalent conjugation of Esc(1-21) to soluble AuNPs [AuNPs@Esc(1-21)] via a poly(ethylene glycol) linker increased by ∼15-fold the activity of the free peptide against the motile and sessile forms of P. aeruginosa without being toxic to human keratinocytes. Furthermore, AuNPs@Esc(1-21) resulted to be significantly more resistant to proteolytic digestion and to disintegrate the bacterial membrane at very low concentration (5 nM). Finally, we demonstrated for the first time the capability of peptide-coated AuNPs to display a wound healing activity on a keratinocytes monolayer. Overall, these findings suggest that our engineered AuNPs can serve as attractive novel biological-derived material for topical treatment of epithelial infections and healing of the injured tissue. Statement of Significance Despite conjugation of AMPs to AuNPs represents a worthwhile solution to face some limitations for their development as new therapeutics, only a very limited number of studies is available on peptide-coated AuNPs. Importantly, this is the first report showing that a covalent binding of a linear AMP via a poly(ethylene glycol) linker to AuNPs highly enhances antipseudomonal activity, preserving the same mode of action of the free peptide, without being harmful. Furthermore, AuNPs@Esc(1-21) are expected to accelerate recovery of an injured skin layer. All together, these findings suggest our peptide-coated AuNPs as attractive novel nanoscale formulation to treat bacterial infections and to heal the injured tissue.. 2017\n",
            "LIT: A System and Benchmark for Light Understanding. A modern lighting system should automatically calibrate itself (light commissioning), assess its own status (which lights are on/off and how dimmed), and allow for the creation or preservation of lighting patterns (adjustability), e.g. after the sunset. Such a system does not exist today, nor (real) data, labels, or metrics are available to compare with and foster progress. In this paper we set the baselines to such a computational system, called LIT, and its applications. Using computational imaging we try to model and benchmark the light variations of indoor scenes with different illuminations (including natural light) and luminaire setups.

            "The Small GTP-Binding Protein Rhes Influences Nigrostriatal-Dependent Motor Behavior During Aging. Background: Here we aimed to evaluate: (1) Rhes mRNA expression in mouse midbrain, (2) the effect of Rhes deletion on the number of dopamine neurons, (3) nigrostriatal-sensitive behavior during aging in knockout mice. Methods: Radioactive in situ hybridization was assessed in adult mice. The beam-walking test was executed in 3-, 6- and 12-month-old mice. Immunohistochemistry of midbrain tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive neurons was performed in 6- and 12-month-old mice. Results: Rhes mRNA is expressed in TH-positive neurons of SNpc and the ventral tegmental area. Moreover, lack of Rhes leads to roughly a 20% loss of nigral TH-positive neurons in both 6- and 12-month-old mutants, when compared with their age-matched controls. Finally, lack of Rhes triggers subtle alterations in motor performance and coordination during aging. Conclusions: Our findings indicate a fine-tuning role of Rhes in regulating the number of TH-positive neurons of the substantia nigra and nigrostriatal-sensitive motor behavior during aging.. 2016\n",

            "Structure-activity relationships of serotonergic 5-MeO-DMT derivatives: insights into psychoactive and thermoregulatory properties. Recent studies have sparked renewed interest in the therapeutic potential of psychedelics for treating depression and other mental health conditions. Simultaneously, the novel psychoactive substances (NPS) phenomenon, with a huge number of NPS emerging constantly, has changed remarkably the illicit drug market, being their scientific evaluation an urgent need. Thus, this study aims to elucidate the impact of amino-terminal modifications to the 5-MeO-DMT molecule on its interactions with serotonin receptors and transporters, as well as its psychoactive and thermoregulatory properties. Our findings demonstrated, using radioligand binding methodologies, that all examined 5-MeO-tryptamines exhibited selectivity for 5-HT1AR over 5-HT2AR. In fact, computational docking analyses predicted a better interaction in the 5-HT1AR binding pocket compared to 5-HT2AR. Our investigation also proved the interaction of these compounds with SERT, revealing that the molecular size of the amino group significantly influenced their affinity. Subsequent experiments involving serotonin uptake, electrophysiology, and superfusion release assays confirmed 5-MeO-pyr-T as the most potent partial 5-HT releaser tested. All tested tryptamines elicited, to some degree, the head twitch response (HTR) in mice, indicative of a potential hallucinogenic effect and mainly mediated by 5-HT2AR activation. However, 5-HT1AR was also shown to be implicated in the hallucinogenic effect, and its activation attenuated the HTR. In fact, tryptamines that produced a higher hypothermic response, mediated by 5-HT1AR, tended to exhibit a lower hallucinogenic effect, highlighting the opposite role of both 5-HT receptors. Moreover, although some 5-MeO-tryptamines elicited very low HTR, they still act as potent 5-HT2AR agonists. In summary, this research offers a comprehensive understanding of the psychopharmacological profile of various amino-substituted 5-MeO-tryptamines, keeping structural aspects in focus and accumulating valuable data in the frame of NPS. Moreover, the unique characteristics of some 5-MeO-tryptamines render them intriguing molecules as mixed-action drugs and provide insight within the search of non-hallucinogenic but 5-HT2AR ligands as therapeutical agents.. 2024\n",

Gut dysbiosis may affects cerebral tumors growth and progression, but the specific metabolites involved in this modulation have not been identified yet. Using a syngeneic mouse model of glioma, we have investigated the role of dysbiosis induced by the administration of non-absorbable antibiotics on mouse metabolome and on tumor microenvironment. We report that antibiotics treatment induced: (1) alteration of the gut and brain metabolome profiles; (2) modeling of tumor microenvironment toward a pro-angiogenic phenotype in which microglia and glioma cells are actively involved; (3) increased glioma stemness; (4) trans-differentiation of glioma cells into endothelial precursor cells, thus increasing vasculogenesis.

            "Galectin-3 is a marker of favorable prognosis and a biologically relevant molecule in neuroblastic tumors. Childhood neuroblastic tumors are characterized by heterogeneous clinical courses, ranging from benign ganglioneuroma (GN) to highly lethal neuroblastoma (NB). Although a refined prognostic evaluation and risk stratification of each tumor patient is becoming increasingly essential to personalize treatment options, currently only few biomolecular markers (essentially MYCN amplification, chromosome 11q status and DNA ploidy) are validated for this purpose in neuroblastic tumors. Here we report that Galectin-3 (Gal-3), a β-galactoside-binding lectin involved in multiple biological functions that has already acquired diagnostic relevance in specific clinical settings, is variably expressed in most differentiated and less aggressive neuroblastic tumors, such as GN and ganglioneuroblastoma, as well as in a subset of NB cases. Gal-3 expression is associated with the INPC histopathological categorization (P<0.001) and Shimada favorable phenotype (P=0.001), but not with other prognostically relevant features. Importantly, Gal-3 expression was associated with a better 5-year overall survival (P=0.003), and with improved cumulative survival in patient subsets at worse prognosis, such as older age at diagnosis, advanced stages or NB histopathological classification. In vitro, Gal-3 expression and nuclear accumulation accompanied retinoic acid-induced cell differentiation in NB cell lines. Forced Gal-3 overexpression increased phenotypic differentiation and substrate adherence, while inhibiting proliferation. Altogether, these findings suggest that Gal-3 is a biologically relevant player for neuroblastic tumors, whose determination by conventional immunohistochemistry might be used for outcome assessment and patient's risk stratification in the clinical setting. © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.. 2014\n",
            "Methotraxate-Loaded Hybrid Nanoconstructs Target Vascular Lesions and Inhibit Atherosclerosis Progression in ApoE−/− Mice. Atherosclerosis is an inflammatory disorder characterized by the progressive thickening of blood vessel walls eventually resulting in acute vascular syndromes. Here, intravenously injectable hybrid nanoconstructs are synthesized for tempering immune cell inflammation locally and systemically. Lipid and polymer chains are nanoprecipitated to form 100 nm spherical polymeric nanoconstructs (SPNs), loaded with methotrexate (MTX) and subsequently labeled with Cu64 and fluorescent probes for combined nuclear/optical imaging. Upon engulfment into macrophages, MTX SPNs intracellularly release their anti-inflammatory cargo significantly lowering the production of proinflammatory cytokine (interleukin 6 and tumor necrosis factor α) already at 0.06 mg mL−1 of MTX. In ApoE−/− mice, fed with high-fat diet up to 17 weeks, nuclear and optical imaging demonstrates specific accumulation of SPNs within lipid-rich plaques along the arterial tree. Histological analyses confirm SPN uptake into macrophages residing within atherosclerotic plaques. A 4-week treatment with biweekly administration of MTX SPNs is sufficient to reduce the plaque burden in ApoE−/− mice by 50%, kept on high-fat diet for 10 weeks. Systemic delivery of MTX to macrophages via multifunctional, hybrid nanoconstructs constitutes an effective strategy to inhibit atherosclerosis progression and induce, potentially, the resorption of vascular lesions.. 2017\n",

We address the use of hidden Markov models (HMM) for shape analysis, based on chain code representation of object contours. HMM represent a widespread approach to the modeling of sequences, and are largely used for many applications, but unfortunately are poorly considered in the literature concerning shape analysis, and in any case, without reference to noise or occlusion sensitivity.

            "Progress in delivery of siRNA-based therapeutics employing nano-vehicles for treatment of prostate cancer. Prostate cancer (PCa) accounts for a high number of deaths in males with no available curative treatments. Patients with PCa are commonly diagnosed in advanced stages due to the lack of symptoms in the early stages. Recently, the research focus was directed toward gene editing in cancer therapy. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) intervention is considered as a powerful tool for gene silencing (knockdown), enabling the suppression of oncogene factors in cancer. This strategy is applied to the treatment of various cancers including PCa. The siRNA can inhibit proliferation and invasion of PCa cells and is able to promote the anti-tumor activity of chemotherapeutic agents. However, the o_-target e_ects of siRNA therapy remarkably reduce its e_cacy in PCa therapy. To date, various carriers were designed to improve the delivery of siRNA and, among them, nanoparticles are of importance. Nanoparticles enable the targeted delivery of siRNAs and enhance their potential in the downregulation of target genes of interest. Additionally, nanoparticles can provide a platform for the co-delivery of siRNAs and anti-tumor drugs, resulting in decreased growth and migration of PCa cells. The e_cacy, specificity, and delivery of siRNAs are comprehensively discussed in this review to direct further studies toward using siRNAs and their nanoscale-delivery systems in PCa therapy and perhaps other cancer types.. 2020\n",

            "Biased Atention Near iCub's Hand Afer Collaborative HRI. Earlier research has indicated that humans prioritize attention to the space close to their hands, commonly known as the \"near-hand effect\". This phenomenon also extends to a human partner's hand, but specifically following a shared physical joint action. Consequently, within human dyads, collaborative interaction results in a shared body representation that might impact fundamental attentional mechanisms. Our project investigates whether a similar effect can emerge from a human-robot interaction scenario. In previous work, we have shown that the mere presence of an anthropomorphic robot's hand is not enough to trigger the near-hand effect. Here, we designed an experiment to assess whether a collaborative human-robot interaction with the humanoid robot iCub could bias human attention toward the robot's hand. After the interaction, we replicated a classical psychological paradigm by adding a robotic condition to measure this attentional bias (i.e., the near-hand effect). Our findings indicate the existence of a near-hand effect triggered by the robot's hand, suggesting that HRI can replicate a shared body representation similar to that observed in human dyads, which may influence our basic attentional mechanisms.. 2024\n",

Human interaction often requires simultaneous precision and flexibility in the coordination of rhythmic behaviour between individuals engaged in joint activity, for example, playing a musical duet or dancing with a partner. This review article addresses the psychological processes and brain mechanisms that enable such rhythmic interpersonal coordination. First, an overview is given of research on the cognitive-motor processes that enable individuals to represent joint action goals and to anticipate, attend and adapt to other’s actions in real time. Second, the neurophysiological mechanisms that underpin rhythmic interpersonal coordination are sought in studies of sensorimotor and cognitive processes that play a role in the representation and integration of selfand other-related actions within and between individuals’ brains. Finally, relationships between social–psychological factors and rhythmic interpersonal coordination are considered from two perspectives, one concerning how social-cognitive tendencies (e.g. empathy) affect coordination, and the other concerning how coordination affects interpersonal affiliation, trust and prosocial behaviour. Our review highlights musical ensemble performance as an ecologically valid yet readily controlled domain for investigating rhythm in joint action.. 2014\n",

Further, we quantify all required adaptations for a real humanoid, such as scaling and equilibrium. Finally, this methodology is applied to a specific humanoid robot (called NAO) in order to illustrate and compare some preliminary results. © 2012 World Scientific Publishing Company. © World Scientic Publishing Company.. 2012\n",
            "Development of In-Cu binary oxide catalysts for hydrogenating CO2via thermocatalytic and electrocatalytic routes. Carbon dioxide (CO2) hydrogenation to obtain valuable chemicals and fuels via thermocatalysis or electrocatalysis is a promising and sustainable method for CO2 utilization. Here, binary In-Cu oxide co-precipitated materials were investigated to evaluate the catalytic performance in the mentioned conversion processes. The In-rich binary material exhibits remarkable selectivity (>60%) to methanol along with high activity for CO2 conversion (>2%) at 21 bar and 300 °C, achieving a productivity of about 265 mgMeOH h−1 gIn2O3−1, which is almost 3 times higher than that of the bare In2O3 catalyst. CO2-temperature programmed desorption revealed that the basicity of the In-rich catalyst remains constant between the calcined and spent samples, so the capacity to adsorb CO2 does not vary when the catalyst is exposed to the reaction atmosphere. Such a catalyst was demonstrated to be active for formate production in the electrochemical process as the main product. Ex situ characterization after testing proved that the In2O3 phase was the active site of methanol synthesis during CO2 hydrogenation at high temperatures and pressures. In contrast, depending on the cell configuration, different indium interfaces were stabilized at the electrocatalyst surface under ambient conditions. It is envisioned that the co-presence of In0, In2O3, and In(OH)3 phases increases the local amount of *CO intermediates, promoting the formation of more reduced products, such as ethanol and 2-propanol, through the *CO dimerization reaction in the electrochemical process. These findings highlight the potential of nonreducible hydroxides as promoters in the electrochemical CO2 reduction process.. 2024\n",

            "N -(2-Oxo-3-oxetanyl)carbamic acid esters as N-acylethanolamine acid amidase inhibitors: Synthesis and structure-activity and structure-property relationships. The β-lactone ring of N-(2-oxo-3-oxetanyl)amides, a class of N-acylethanolamine acid amidase (NAAA) inhibitors endowed with anti-inflammatory properties, is responsible for both NAAA inhibition and low compound stability. Here, we investigate the structure-activity and structure-property relationships for a set of known and new β-lactone derivatives, focusing on the new class of N-(2-oxo-3-oxetanyl)carbamates. Replacement of the amide group with a carbamate one led to different stereoselectivity for NAAA inhibition and higher intrinsic stability, because of the reduced level of intramolecular attack at the lactone ring. The introduction of a syn methyl at the β-position of the lactone further improved chemical stability. A tert-butyl substituent in the side chain reduced the reactivity with bovine serum albumin. (2S,3R)-2-Methyl-4-oxo-3-oxetanylcarbamic acid 5-phenylpentyl ester (27, URB913/ARN077) inhibited NAAA with good in vitro potency (IC 50 = 127 nM) and showed improved stability.

            "A target field approach to open MRI magnet design. The design of an fMRI magnet for the study of the human motor cortex poses a number of challenges due to the necessity of maintaining the subject in a natural, erect position, with free access to the environment. This paper presents the design of an asymmetric superconducting magnet composed of racetrack coils. The coil configuration is derived from the one presented in [1] from which the non-planar coils have been eliminated, with significant simplifications of the manufacturing process. The position of the coils is defined along the principles described in [1] and the current in the coils is determined by means of an approach similar to the Inverse Boundary Method [2-4] in which the goal is established as a set of spherical harmonic coefficients. The major challenge in the design lies in limiting the coil currents to sustainable values without compromising the field homogeneity. The current limit requires an increase in the number of winding layers that, in turn, induces a change in the physical dimensions, making the system nonlinear. It is shown how this can be counteracted by means of an iterative procedure that converges to acceptable results. In the final configuration the magnet accommodates a sitting individual and produces a field intensity of 1.4 T. It consists of planar coils only with current densities and maximum field intensities compatible with currently available superconductors. © 2002-2011 IEEE.. 2012\n",

A shift of 1450 cm-1 mode towards higher frequency upon increasing the time delay was observed by taking the Fourier transform of different time windows of the signal. The shift is due to relaxation of the vibrational wavepacket within an anharmonic potential energy surface.. 1999\n",
            "Assisted guidance system for Micro ROV in underwater data gathering missions.. Recent years have seen an increasingly interest by the scientific community in the realization of minimally invasive technologies and tools for carrying out activities like exploration and intervention in the marine environment. This paper will describe the design and realization of a novel assisted guidance system for a Micro ROV, which is part of a more complex robotic system, together with a large ROV. Within this framework, the smaller robot is employed as a mobile appendix of the larger one, while the latter acts as an actuated garage and a supply vessel of the first. During operations, the ROVs guidance systems are decoupled, that is the larger one works in station keeping or in path following, either automatically or under the supervision of an expert operator, while the smaller one is teleoperated by a pilot not necessarily trained. This structure allows scientists like marine biologists, archaeologists and oceanographers to operate directly the Micro ROV, combining their knowledge of the application domain with the ability of professional ROV pilots. The described robotic structure is potentially very efficient and versatile, but its realization implies the development of solutions which could support the Micro ROV untrained operators. For this reason, the present paper focuses on the description of an assisted guidance system for Micro ROV aimed at achieving the objective above. The system makes the Micro ROVs pilot keep the vehicle within a given range from the large ROV, by means of a reactive joystick. Generation of the reactive force is described, and the use of the assisted guidance system in performing underwater data gathering missions of an archaeological site is discussed. © 2012 IEEE.. 2012\n",
            "Perceived surface slant is systematically biased in the actively-generated optic flow. Humans make systematic errors in the 3D interpretation of the optic flow in both passive and active vision. These systematic distortions can be predicted by a biologically-inspired model which disregards self-motion information resulting from head movements (Caudek, Fantoni, & Domini 2011). Here, we tested two predictions of this model: (1) A plane that is stationary in an earth-fixed reference frame will be perceived as changing its slant if the movement of the observer's head causes a variation of the optic flow; (2) a surface that rotates in an earth-fixed reference frame will be perceived to be stationary, if the surface rotation is appropriately yoked to the head movement so as to generate a variation of the surface slant but not of the optic flow. Both predictions were corroborated by two experiments in which observers judged the perceived slant of a random-dot planar surface during egomotion. We found qualitatively similar biases for monocular and binocular viewing of the simulated surfaces, although, in principle, the simultaneous presence of disparity and motion cues allows for a veridical recovery of surface slant. © 2012 Fantoni et al.. 2012\n",
            "1st European portable on orbit 3D printer demonstrator on the ISS. Additive Manufacturing (AM) technologies represent a solution for enabling astronauts to manufacture parts in situ, as needed, starting from feedstock material. The importance of these capabilities are particularly evident in manned space exploration missions, e.g. on human Mars missions, where a paramount cargo capability would be necessary to supply the astronauts with everything they may need during the mission. Also, item obtained by 3D printing process may have a lighter structure than if manufactured out of conventional process, thus helping in reducing overall mass at launch. The capability to make parts in space, during the mission, would dramatically reduce the mass sent to the destination site and also help astronauts in solving some of the problems that can occur during a space mission: if the Apollo had been equipped with a 3d printer, the filter housing with a suitable interface could have been easily manufactured by astronauts using Additive Manufacturing technology. The Portable on-Orbit Printer 3D represents the first European additive manufacturing experiment in space. The Printer implements the Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM) process for the fabrication of parts using the PLA thermoplastic polymer. The objective of the experiment is to validate the 3D printing technology in microgravity and to pave the way for an Italian and European development of the additive manufacturing technology on board the ISS and, more in general, in space. Portable on-Orbit Printer 3D is a 3D printer developed by TAS-I together with ALTRAN and IIT. The project has been managed and funded by ASI in the frame of 2012 AO \"Bando Volo Umano Spaziale\". The Printer has been launched to ISS within the Cygnus module with OA-4 resupply mission (Atlas 5) on December 6th, 2015. The astronaut on-orbit operations are limited to activate the Built-In Test and the \"printing\" process that lasts about 50 minutes. At the end the printer is returned to Earth were the \"printed\" part is removed and analyzed. Scientific goal of the experiment is mainly to prove that FDM fabrication with a representative type of polymeric material is not significantly influenced by the gravity acceleration field. This paper will present the results of the demonstration activities performed on orbit and the results of the analysis performed on the on orbit \"printed\" part in comparison with the same part \"printed\" on ground.. 2016\n",
            "Vibrational spectrum of solid picene (C 22H 14). Recently, Mitsuhashi etal observed superconductivity with a transition temperature up to 18K in potassium doped picene (C 22H 14), a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon compound (Mitsuhashi etal 2010 Nature 464 76). Theoretical analysis indicates the importance of electronphonon coupling in the superconducting mechanisms of these systems, with different emphasis on inter- and intra-molecular vibrations, depending on the approximations used. Here we present a combined experimental and ab initio study of the Raman and infrared spectrum of undoped solid picene, which allows us to unambiguously assign the vibrational modes. This combined study enables the identification of the modes which couple strongly to electrons and hence can play an important role in the superconducting properties of the doped samples. © 2012 IOP Publishing Ltd.. 2012\n",
            "Integration of confidence information by markov random fields for reconstruction of underwater 3D acoustic images. This paper describes a technique for the integration of confidence information using a Markov Random Fields approach to improve the reconstruction process of 3D acoustical images. Beamforming, a method widely applied in acoustic imaging, is used to arrange backscattered echoes received by a two-dimensional array antenna in order to generate two images where each pixel represents the distance (range) from the sensor plane and the related confidence of the measure, respectively. Unfortunately, this kind of images are plagued by several problems due to the nature of the signal and to the related sensing system, thus heavily affecting data quality. In the proposed algorithm, range and confidence images are modelled as Markov Random Fields and several energy formulations are devised to exploit both types of data, leading to the reconstruction and segmentation of acoustic images. Results show the better performances of the proposed method as compared with classical methods disregarding reliability information.. 1997\n",
            "Fully non-homogeneous hidden Markov model double net: A generative model for haplotype reconstruction and block discovery. Objective: In the last decade, haplotype reconstruction in unrelated individuals and haplotype block discovery have riveted the attention of computer scientists due to the involved strong computational aspects. Such tasks are usually addressed separately, but recently, statistical techniques have permitted them to be solved jointly. Following this trend we propose a generative model that permits researchers to solve the two problems jointly. Method: The model inference is based on variational learning, which permits one to estimate quickly the model parameters while remaining robust even to local minima. The model parameters are then used to segment genotypes into blocks by thresholding a quantitative measure of boundary presence. Results: Experiments on real data are presented, and state-of-the-art systems for haplotype reconstruction and strategies for block estimation are considered as comparison. Conclusions: The proposed method can be used for a fast and reliable estimation of haplotype frequencies and the relative block structure. Moreover, the method can be easily used as part of a more complex system. The threshold used for block discovery can be related to the quality-of-fit reached in the model learning, resulting in an unsupervised strategy for block estimation. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

            "Model tracking for video-based virtual reality. This paper presents a technique for tracking complex objects (both polyhedral and smooth boundaries) in a monocular sequence. Our aim is to use this model tracking method in an augmented reality context to compute the pose of a real object to be able to register it with a synthetic one. A scalar score function for an object pose is defined, based on the local image gradient along the projected model boundaries. A local search is then carried out in the configuration space of the pose to maximize the score. This technique is robust to occlusions, since the whole object contour is used, not just a few control points. The proposed method is effective yet simple. No image feature extraction is necessary and no complex temporal evolution is used. Experimental results with a real sequence show the good performance of our technique. © 2001 IEEE.. 2001\n",

Five cerebellar patients and six age-paired control subjects were asked to estimate the occluded end point position of the shoulder’s trajectories in Sit-to-Stand (STS) or Back-to-Sit (BTS) conditions, following or not biological rules. Contrarily to the control group, the prediction accuracy of the end point position in cerebellar patients did not depend on biological rules. Interestingly, both groups presented similar results when estimating the vanishing position of the target. Taken together, these results suggest that cerebellar damage affectsthe capacity of predicting upcoming actions by observation.. 2021\n",

            "Origin of de-swelling and dynamics of dense ionic microgel suspensions. A direct consequence of the finite compressibility of a swollen microgel is that it can shrink and deform in response to an external perturbation. As a result, concentrated suspensions of these particles exhibit relaxation dynamics and rheological properties which can be very different with respect to those of a hard sphere suspension or an emulsion. We study the reduction in size of ionic microgels in response to increasing number of particles to show that particle shrinkage originates primarily from steric compression, and that the effect of ion-induced de-swelling of the polymer network is negligible. With increasing particle concentration, the single particle dynamics switch from those typical of a liquid to those of a super-cooled liquid and finally to those of a glass. However, the transitions occur at volume fractions much higher than those characterizing a hard sphere system. In the super-cooled state, the distribution of displacements is non-Gaussian and the dependence of the structural relaxation time on volume fraction is describable by a Volger-Fulcher-Tammann function. © 2012 American Institute of Physics.. 2012\n",
            "Bilateral effects of unilateral cerebellar lesions as detected by voxel based morphometry and diffusion imaging. Over the last decades, the importance of cerebellar processing for cortical functions has been acknowledged and consensus was reached on the strict functional and structural cor-tico-cerebellar interrelations. From an anatomical point of view strictly contralateral interconnections link the cerebellum to the cerebral cortex mainly through the middle and superior cerebellar peduncle. Diffusion MRI (dMRI) based tractography has already been applied to address cortico-cerebellar-cortical loops in healthy subjects and to detect diffusivity alteration patterns in patients with neurodegenerative pathologies of the cerebellum. In the present study we used dMRI-based tractography to determine the degree and pattern of pathological changes of cerebellar white matter microstructure in patients with focal cerebellar lesions. Diffusion imaging and high-resolution volumes were obtained in patients with left cerebellar lesions and in normal controls. Middle cerebellar peduncles and superior cerebellar peduncles were reconstructed by multi fiber diffusion tractography. From each tract, measures of microscopic damage were assessed, and despite the presence of unilateral lesions, bilateral diffusivity differences in white matter tracts were found comparing patients with normal controls. Consistently, bilateral alterations were also evidenced in specific brain regions linked to the cerebellum and involved in higher-level functions. This could be in line with the evidence that in the presence of unilateral cerebellar lesions, different cognitive functions can be affected and they are not strictly linked to the side of the cerebellar lesion.. 2017\n",
            "Reconstruction of complex environments by robust pre-aligned ICP. This paper proposes a technique for three-dimensional reconstruction of an underwater environment from range views acquired by an acoustic camera. The final target of the work lies in improving the understanding of a human operator driving an underwater remotely operated vehicle floating close to an offshore structure. Due to the narrow field of view and the absence of control of the sensor position, no information is available about the degree of over-lapping between the range images; further, speckle noise and low resolution make more difficult the registration process. In this paper, we propose a preprocessing method which gives a coarse alignment of range images prior to running the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm for the accurate registration of views pairs. The pre-alignment is based on the matching between the three-dimensional skeletons extracted from the images. A comparative analysis is presented where our method is compared with plain ICP, and with a technique based on principal components analysis.. 2001\n",
            "In Vitro and Ex Vivo Investigation of the Effects of Polydopamine Nanoparticle Size on Their Antioxidant and Photothermal Properties: Implications for Biomedical Applications. Polydopamine (PDA) is a polymer that derives from the self-polymerization of the biomolecule dopamine. It can be easily synthesized to obtain spherical nanoparticles (PDNPs), tunable in terms of size, loaded cargo, and surface functionalization. PDNPs have been increasingly attracting the attention of the research community due to their elevated versatility in the biomedicine field, for their excellent ability to encapsulate drugs, to convert near-infrared (NIR) radiation into heat, and to act as an antioxidant agent. Size is an important aspect to be considered, especially concerning the specific intended field of application. This work aims at investigating how changes in the size of PDNPs affect the nanoparticle properties relevant for biomedical applications, especially focusing on cancer nanomedicine. A library of differently sized PDNPs (from 145 to 957 nm) has been obtained by varying the ammonia/dopamine molar ratio during the synthesis procedure, and detailed characterization in terms of biocompatibility, cell internalization, antioxidant capacity, and photothermal conversion has been carried out. Experiments showed that nanoparticles with a larger diameter display higher NIR absorbance, superior resistance to degradation, and higher photothermal conversion capacity (the latter confirmed by a mathematical model). On the other hand, a reduction in diameter size induces both improved antioxidant properties and enhanced cellular uptake. Herein, we provide a useful tool, allowing one to choose the proper size of PDNPs tailored for specific biomedical applications.. 2022\n",

Serological markers of Nuromyelitis Optica (NMO), an autoimmune disorder of the central nervous system, are autoantibodies targeting the astrocytic water channel aquaporin-4 (AQP4). We have previously demonstrated that the main epitopes for these autoantibodies (AQP4-IgG) are generated by the supramolecular arrangement of AQP4 tetramers into an Orthogonal Array of Particles (OAPs). Many tests have been developed to detect AQP4- IgG in patient sera but several procedural issues affect OAP assembly and consequently test sensitivity. To date, the protein based ELISA test shows the lowest sensitivity while representing a valid alternative to the more sensitive cell based assay (CBA), which, however, shows economic, technical and interpretation problems. Here we have developed a high perfomance ELISA in which native OAPs are used as the molecular target. To this aim a native size exclusion chromatography method has been developed to isolate integral, highly pure and AQP4-IgG-recognized OAPs from rat brain. These OAPs were immobilized and oriented on a plastic plate by a sandwich approach and 139 human sera were tested, including 67 sera from NMO patients. The OAP-ELISA showed a 99% specificity and a higher sensitivity (91%) compared to the CBA test. A comparative analysis revealed an end-point titer three orders of magnitude higher than the commercial ELISA and six times higher than our in-house CBA test. We show that CNS-extracted OAPs are crucial elements in order to perform an efficient AQP4-IgG test and the OAP-ELISA developed represents a valid alternative to the CBA currently used.. 2015\n",
            "Requirement for the histone deacetylase Hdac3 for the inflammatory gene expression program in macrophages. Histone deacetylases (HDACs) regulate inflammatory gene expression, as indicated by the potent antiinflammatory activity of pan-HDAC inhibitors. However, the specific contribution of each of the 11 HDAC proteins to the inflammatory gene expression program is unknown. Using an integrated genomic approach, we found that Hdac3-deficient macrophages were unable to activate almost half of the inflammatory gene expression program when stimulated with LPS. A large part of the activation defect was attributable to loss of basal and LPS-inducible expression of IFN-β, which maintains Stat1 protein levels in unstimulated cells and acts in an autocrine/paracrine manner after stimulation to promote a secondary wave of Stat1-dependent gene expression. Loss of Hdac3-mediated repression of nuclear receptors led to hyperacetylation of thousands of genomic sites and associated gene derepression. The up-regulation of the constitutively expressed prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase, Ptgs1 (Cox-1), a nuclear receptor target, had a causative role in the phenotype because its chemical inhibition reverted, albeit partially, the Ifn-β activation defect. These data indicate a central role for Hdac3 in inflammation and may have relevance for the use of selective Hdac inhibitors as antiinflammatory agents.. 2012\n",
            "Beam pattern formulation and analysis for wide-band beamforming systems using sparse arrays. This communication addresses the evaluation of beam patterns (BPs) in active beamforming systems using wide-band signals and sparse arrays. Usually, BPs are computed under a narrow-band hypothesis according to which a simple analytical and closed-form equation can be used. In this communication, with reference to imaging applications, the BP for wide-band signals is redefined on the basis of beam-signal maxima, and a quasi-closed form of the analytical formulation is achieved for any inter-element spacing. It can be noticed that, under wide-band conditions, the height of these grating lobes can be predicted and that depends only on the pulse duration and on the number of array elements, but does not depend on the spacing between elements. As a result, the proposed quasi-closed form supports the design of very sparse arrays that show beam-pattern profiles of great interest for imaging applications. © 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.. 1997\n",

Long-lived and ultraconfined plasmons in two-dimensional (2D) electron systems may provide a subwavelength diagnostic tool to investigate localized dielectric, electromagnetic, and pseudo-electromagnetic perturbations. In this article, we present a general theoretical framework to study the scattering of 2D plasmons against such perturbations in the nonretarded limit. We discuss both parabolic-band and massless Dirac fermion 2D electron systems. Our theory starts from a Lippmann-Schwinger equation for the screened potential in an inhomogeneous 2D electron system and utilizes as inputs analytical long-wavelength expressions for the density-density response function, going beyond the local approximation. We present illustrative results for the scattering of 2D plasmons against a pointlike charged impurity and a one-dimensional electrostatic barrier due to a line of charges. Exact numerical results obtained from the solution of the Lippmann-Schwinger equation are compared with approximate results based on the Born and eikonal approximations.

            "Unconventional electroabsorption in monolayer MoS2. Signal modulation in optoelectronics is obtained by modulation of either the refractive index or the absorbance by an electric field. However, electromodulators have not kept up with the miniaturization of other electronic and optical components. Here we show a strong transverse electroabsorption signal in a monolayer of the 2D semiconductor MoS2. The electroabsorption spectrum is dominated by an apparent linewidth broadening of around 15% at a modulated voltage of only Vpp = 0.5 V. Contrary to known variants of the Stark effect, the broadening increases linearly with the applied field strength and arises from a linear variation of the distance between the strongly overlapping exciton and trion resonances.

            "Adaptive camera regulation for investigation of real scenes. An adaptive strategy for regulating the intrinsic parameters of a charge coupled device (CCD) visual camera is presented. The parameter regulation procedure is based on the computation of the \"quality\" of an acquired signal by means of a set of functions which estimate the goodness of the datum. Each function performs a quantitative evaluation by computing several features derived from the high-frequency content of an image or from the histogram analysis. The regulation strategy uses such values to compute the actual values of the camera parameters, i.e., focusing distance, aperture diameter, electronic gain, and black level. Moreover, the same strategy can be applied both to the whole image and to smaller suhareas, therefore providing a fooisof-attention mechanism. This is useful for automatic investigation and control of environments subject to dynamically changing conditions (e.g., illumination and structure of a scene), whenever it is not possible to interact directly with such environments. © 1996 IEEE.. 1996\n",

The potential of such systems would be greatly enhanced if the mechanical changes could he photoinduced, thereby attaining the high control offered by laser irradiation. To this end. a systematic study of optically driven molecular actuators, demonstrated by the laser-controlled bending of cantilevers, has been undertaken. Their actuation relies on the reversible photochemical changes of incorporated molecules. In particular, polymer films of polyethylmethacrylate-co-methylacrylatc (PEMMA) doped with photochromic spiropyran molecules, which are used as cantilevers, undergo photoinduced mechanical changes. The photochromic molecules reversibly convert upon irradiation at appropriate laser wavelengths between two isomeric forms with different physicochemical properties, such as structure and dielectric constant.

            "Coupling dairy wastewaters for nutritional balancing and water recycling: sustainable heterologous 2-phenylethanol production by engineered cyanobacteria. Microalgae biotechnology is hampered by the high production costs and the massive usage of water during large-volume cultivations. These drawbacks can be softened by the production of high-value compounds and by adopting metabolic engineering strategies to improve their performances and productivity. Today, the most sustainable approach is the exploitation of industrial wastewaters for microalgae cultivation, which couples valuable biomass production with water resource recovery. Among the food processing sectors, the dairy industry generates the largest volume of wastewaters through the manufacturing process. These effluents are typically rich in dissolved organic matter and nutrients, which make it a challenging and expensive waste stream for companies to manage. Nevertheless, these rich wastewaters represent an appealing resource for microalgal biotechnology. In this study, we propose a sustainable approach for high-value compound production from dairy wastewaters through cyanobacteria. This strategy is based on a metabolically engineered strain of the model cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 (already published elsewhere) for 2-phenylethanol (2-PE). 2-PE is a high-value aromatic compound that is widely employed as a fragrance in the food and cosmetics industry thanks to its pleasant floral scent. First, we qualitatively assessed the impact of four dairy effluents on cyanobacterial growth to identify the most promising substrates. Both tank-washing water and the liquid effluent of exhausted sludge resulted as suitable nutrient sources. Thus, we created an ideal buffer system by combining the two wastewaters while simultaneously providing balanced nutrition and completely avoiding the need for fresh water. The combination of 75% liquid effluent of exhausted sludge and 25% tank-washing water with a fine-tuning ammonium supplementation yielded 180 mg L−1 of 2-PE and a biomass concentration of 0.6 gDW L-1 within 10 days. The mixture of 90% exhausted sludge and 10% washing water produced the highest yield of 2-PE (205 mg L−1) and biomass accumulation (0.7 gDW L−1), although in 16 days. Through these treatments, the phosphates were completely consumed, and nitrogen was removed in a range of 74%–77%. Overall, our approach significantly valorized water recycling and the exploitation of valuable wastewaters to circularly produce marketable compounds via microalgae biotechnology, laying a promising groundwork for subsequent implementation and scale-up.. 2024\n",
            "Mechanical actuator for biomimetic propulsion and the effect of the caudal fin elasticity on the swimming performance. This paper presents a mechanical actuator for the biomimetic propulsion of swimming devices and the experimental study of the effect of the caudal fin elasticity on the overall performance. The design of the proposed drive allows the DC motor to operate at constant speed, so all the power of the motor is spent only for the motion of the caudal fin. A prototype of the actuator, in which the caudal fin serves as a driving element, is manufactured and tested in both laboratory and natural conditions. The swimming speed, the thrust efficiency and the maneuverability are evaluated for caudal fins with different stiffness. The caudal fin whose rigidity varies relative to both vertical and horizontal cross-section, exhibits the best performance. The achieved results also confirm that the proposed actuator could be of great interest to applications in the field of underwater operation, ocean investigation and environmental protection. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.. 2012\n",
            "Soil biota and chemical interactions promote co-existence in co-evolved grassland communities. Plant populations can exhibit local adaptation to their abiotic environment, such as climate and soil properties, as well as biotic components such as the chemical signatures of dominant plant species and mutualistic and pathogenic microbial populations. While patterns of local adaptation in individual species are widely recorded, the importance of microevolutionary processes for plant community assembly and function is poorly understood. Here, we examined how a history of long-term co-existence, and thus potential for local co-adaptation, influenced the process of plant community assembly. Soil inocula and seeds of eight plant species were collected from three calcareous grasslands with a long history of grazing within a single geographical region. Mesocosm communities were established using local genotypes from a single site or an artificial mixture of genotypes from two different sites. To investigate the role of root exudates and local (‘home’) and non-local (‘away’) soil biota as mediators of plant species co-existence, the population origin treatment was combined with the addition of activated carbon, which is known to adsorb exudates from soil, and sterilization of soil inocula. Individual-, species- and mesocosm-level responses were measured over the course of three growing seasons. We found that root exudates promoted seedling survival, species co-existence and productivity in assemblages of genotypes originating from the same community but had a weak impact in mixed, novel communities. Soil biota promoted the growth of subordinate forbs and restrained the growth of dominant graminoids, particularly in communities composed of local genotypes. The effects of population origin were significant in the first 2 years of the experiment but were not detectable in the third year when interbreeding and new seedling establishment took place. Plant genotypes coupled with ‘home’ microbial inoculum experienced a stronger reduction in growth compared with genotypes exposed to ‘away’ inoculum, indicating that plants experienced home-field disadvantage in interactions with soil biota. Synthesis. Our study demonstrates that the mechanisms of initial grassland community assembly depend on community history, with below-ground chemical interactions and plant interactions with soil biota becoming stronger drivers of dynamics in established and potentially co-evolved communities.. 2019\n",
            "Novel 3D plasmonic nano-electrodes for cellular investigations and neural interfaces. We propose the development of an innovative plasmonic-electronic multifunctional platform, capable at the same time of performing chemical analysis and electronic recordings from a cellular interface. The system, based on 3D hollow metallic nanotubes, integrated on customized multi-electrode-arrays, allows the study of neuronal signaling over different lengths, spanning from the molecular, to the cellular, to the network scale. Here we show that the same structures are efficient electric field enhancers, despite the continuous metal layer at the base, which connects them to the electric components of the integrated circuits. The methodology we propose, due to its simplicity and high throughput, has the potential for further improvements both in the field of plasmonics, and in the integration on large areas of commercial active electronic devices.. 2014\n",

            "Insulinlike growth factor (IGF)-1 administration ameliorates disease manifestations in a mouse model of spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy. Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy is an X-linked motor neuron disease caused by polyglutamine expansion in the androgen receptor. Patients develop slowly progressive proximal muscle weakness, muscle atrophy and fasciculations. Affected individuals often show gynecomastia, testicular atrophy and reduced fertility as a result of mild androgen insensitivity. No effective diseasemodifying therapy is currently available for this disease. Our recent studies have demonstrated that insulinlike growth factor (IGF)-1 reduces the mutant androgen receptor toxicity through activation of Akt in vitro, and spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy transgenic mice that also overexpress a noncirculating muscle isoform of IGF-1 have a less severe phenotype. Here we sought to establish the efficacy of daily intraperitoneal injections of mecasermin rinfabate, recombinant human IGF-1 and IGF-1 binding protein 3, in a transgenic mouse model expressing the mutant androgen receptor with an expanded 97 glutamine tract. The study was done in a controlled, randomized, blinded fashion, and, to reflect the clinical settings, the injections were started after the onset of disease manifestations. The treatment resulted in increased Akt phosphorylation and reduced mutant androgen receptor aggregation in muscle. In comparison to vehicle-treated controls, IGF-1-treated transgenic mice showed improved motor performance, attenuated weight loss and increased survival. Our results suggest that peripheral tissue can be targeted to improve the spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy phenotype and indicate that IGF-1 warrants further investigation in clinical trials as a potential treatment for this disease.. 2012\n",

            "Resummation techniques in the kinetic-theoretical approach to subgrid turbulence modeling. The potential role of resummation techniques in the kinetic theory approach to subgrid turbulence modeling is discussed. Based on Pade approximation, these techniques are best applied not to the true Boltzmann equation, but to finite-dimensional (Grad) hyperbolic truncations thereof, thus are suitable to the kinetic approach to turbulence. Further, as subgrid turbulence also produces hyperviscous effects, besides eddy viscosity, the kinetic approach, with accurate treatment of Burnett and Super-Burnett corrections, is essential to provide such natural links. Basic ideas behind resummation techniques are shown for truncated Grad systems, and the possibility of exporting these techniques to the kinetic turbulence framework is assessed.. 2000\n",
            "Design Maps for the Hyperthermic Treatment of Tumors with Superparamagnetic Nanoparticles. A plethora of magnetic nanoparticles has been developed and investigated under different alternating magnetic fields (AMF) for the hyperthermic treatment of malignant tissues. Yet, clinical applications of magnetic hyperthermia are sporadic, mostly due to the low energy conversion efficiency of the metallic nanoparticles and the high tissue concentrations required. Here, we study the hyperthermic performance of commercially available formulations of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIOs), with core diameter of 5, 7 and 14 nm, in terms of absolute temperature increase ΔT and specific absorption rate (SAR). These nanoparticles are operated under a broad range of AMF conditions, with frequency f varying between 0.2 and 30 MHz; field strength H ranging from 4 to 10 kA m-1; and concentration cMNP varying from 0.02 to 3.5 mg ml-1. At high frequency field (~30 MHz), non specific heating dominates and ΔT correlates with the electrical conductivity of the medium. At low frequency field (<1 MHz), non specific heating is negligible and the relaxation of the SPIO within the AMF is the sole energy source. We show that the ΔT of the medium grows linearly with cMNP, whereas the SARMNP of the magnetic nanoparticles is independent of cMNP and varies linearly with f and H2. Using a computational model for heat transport in a biological tissue, the minimum requirements for local hyperthermia (Ttissue >42°C) and thermal ablation (Ttissue >50°C) are derived in terms of cMNP, operating AMF conditions and blood perfusion. The resulting maps can be used to rationally design hyperthermic treatments and identifying the proper route of administration - systemic versus intratumor injection - depending on the magnetic and biodistribution properties of the nanoparticles. © 2013 Cervadoro et al.. 2013\n",

            "An automated plasma protein fractionation design: High-throughput perspectives for proteomic analysis. Background: Human plasma, representing the most complete record of the individual phenotype, is an appealing sample for proteomics analysis in clinical applications. Up to today, the major obstacle in a proteomics study of plasma is the large dynamic range of protein concentration and the efforts of many researchers focused on the resolution of this important drawback. Findings. In this study, proteins from pooled plasma samples were fractionated according to their chemical characteristics on a home-designed SPE automated platform. The resulting fractions were digested and further resolved by reversed-phase liquid chromatography coupled with MALDI TOF/TOF mass spectrometry. A total of 712 proteins were successfully identified until a concentration level of ng/mL. Pearson correlation coefficient was used to test reproducibility. Conclusions: Our multidimensional fractionation approach reduced the analysis time (2days are enough to process 16 plasma samples filling a 96-well plate) over the conventional gel-electrophoresis or multi-LC column based methods. The robotic processing, avoiding contaminants or lack of sample handling skill, promises highly reproducible specimen analyses (more than 85% Pearson correlation).

Balancing a stick on the fingertip while standing upright is a dual balancing task that requires the integration of two independent control systems. This is a completely novel experimental paradigm for attempting to understand how the brain deals with equilibrium in a general way. Preliminary results are presented and interpreted in the framework of an intermittent control policy extended to include a dual balancing task. In particular the study reveals that the upright standing (the less critical task) is modified in an adaptive way, in order to facilitate the more critical task, i.e. stick balancing.. 2019\n",

Our supervised classification method aims at recognizing patterns of unlabeled cells based on an annotated dataset. First, the cell images need to be indexed by encoding them in a feature space. For this purpose, we propose tailored bio-inspired features relying on the distribution of contrast information. Then, a supervised learning algorithm is proposed for classifying the cells. We carried out experiments on cellular images related to the diagnosis of autoimmune diseases, testing our classification method on the HEp-2 Cells dataset of Foggia et al (CBMS 2010).

            "Detecting mutually exclusive interactions in protein-protein interaction maps. Comprehensive protein interaction maps can complement genetic and biochemical experiments and allow the formulation of new hypotheses to be tested in the system of interest. The computational analysis of the maps may help to focus on interesting cases and thereby to appropriately prioritize the validation experiments. We show here that, by automatically comparing and analyzing structurally similar regions of proteins of known structure interacting with a common partner, it is possible to identify mutually exclusive interactions present in the maps with a sensitivity of 70% and a specificity higher than 85% and that, in about three fourth of the correctly identified complexes, we also correctly recognize at least one residue (five on average) belonging to the interaction interface. Given the present and continuously increasing number of proteins of known structure, the requirement of the knowledge of the structure of the interacting proteins does not substantially impact on the coverage of our strategy that can be estimated to be around 25%. We also introduce here the Estrella server that embodies this strategy, is designed for users interested in validating specific hypotheses about the functional role of a protein-protein interaction and it also allows access to pre-computed data for seven organisms. © 2012 Sánchez Claros, Tramontano.. 2012\n",

We report a systematic computational study of the structural and optoelectronic properties of unsaturated ZnO and ZnS nanoclusters with hexagonal prism structure, as a function of length and diameter. We computed the fundamental gap using density functional theory (DFT) in the framework of the ?SCF scheme and the optical gap by means of time-dependent DFT (TDDFT). We found that all ZnO nanostructures transform from wurtzite to graphitic phase. On the contrary, ZnS nanocrystals with diameters above ∼1 nm are found to transform to a zeolite BCT phase. These different structural properties reflect in a very different size dependence of the electronic and optical properties, with a strong discontinuity for ZnS particles. The correlation between morphology and optoelectronic properties is demonstrated by considering models of saturated clusters preserving the wurtzite phase. We additionally compared DFT/TDDFT results with many-body perturbation theory methods showing a general good agreement among the two techniques for this class of nanocrystals of the two materials. © 2012 American Chemical Society.. 2012\n",

            "In vitro study of polydopamine nanoparticles as protective antioxidant agents in fibroblasts derived from ARSACS patients. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are active molecules involved in several biological functions. When the production of ROS is not counterbalanced by the action of protective antioxidant mechanisms present in living organisms, a condition of oxidative stress can arise with consequent damage to biological structures. The brain is one of the main ROS-generating organs in the human body, with the consequence that most of the neurological disorders are associated with the overproduction of ROS. Autosomal recessive spastic ataxia of Charlevoix-Saguenay (ARSACS) is a neurodegenerative disease associated with mutations in the sacsin gene (SACS). At cellular level, ARSACS is characterized by mitochondrial impairments, a reduction in bioenergetic processes, and both by an over-production of and by an over-sensitivity to ROS. Several antioxidant molecules have been proposed as a potential treatment for ARSACS, such as idebenone and resveratrol. Polydopamine nanoparticles (PDNPs) gained significant attention in recent years owing to their peculiar physical/chemical properties, and especially because of their antioxidant activity. PDNPs have shown a great ROS scavenging capacity that, combined with their completely organic nature that grants them the ability to be degraded and excreted by living organisms, make them a promising candidate in the treatment of oxidative stress-related disorders. In this work, we assessed the effect of PDNPs on human fibroblasts derived from ARSACS patients, in terms of antioxidant properties and protein expression. PDNPs interaction with fibroblasts was analyzed in terms of biocompatibility, internalization and uptake pathway, reduction of ROS levels, prevention of ROS-induced apoptosis/necrosis, and protective action upon ROS-induced mitochondrial dysfunctions. Moreover, a complete proteomic analysis was performed. Altogether, our data showed that PDNPs can partially counteract ROS-induced damages in both ARSACS patient-derived fibroblasts, making them a potential therapeutic candidate to treat -or at least to ameliorate- the condition of oxidative stress associated with ARSACS.. 2022\n",

The humanoid robot iCub is currently equipped with an array of capacitive sensors that provide pressure information throughout the body of the robot. Even though for some applications this type of data is sufficient, it is not always the case for the fingertips of the robot. In particular, the current sensors do not provide enough information for performing agile manipulation, where both intensity and direction of the exerted force on the fingertips are relevant for the proper execution of the task. In this paper, we present a single 3-Axis small magnetic sensor module and we show its effectiveness when integrated into the fingertips of the iCub. The sensor module is derived from uSkin, presented in previous works from our laboratory. Replaceable fingertips were designed, built and integrated via software into the low level communication network of the robot, providing fast 3D information about the contact between the fingertips and objects.

SNAP-25, a membrane-associated protein of the nerve terminal, is specifically cleaved by botulinum neurotoxins serotypes A and E, which cause human and animal botulism by blocking neurotransmitter release at the neuromuscular junction. Here we show that these two metallo-endopeptidase toxins cleave SNAP-25 at two distinct carboxyl-terminal sites. Serotype A catalyses the hydrolysis of the Gln197-Arg198 peptide bond, while serotype E cleaves the Arg180-Ile181 peptide linkage.

The predictive accuracy of state-of-the-art continuum models for charge transport in organic semiconductors is highly dependent on the accurate tuning of a set of parameters whose values cannot be effectively estimated either by direct measurements or by first principles. Fitting the complete set of model parameters at once to experimental data requires to set up extremely complex multi-objective optimization problems whose solution is, on the one hand, overwhelmingly computationally expensive and, on the other, it provides no guarantee of the physical soundness of the value obtained for each individual parameter. In the present study we present a step-by-step procedure that enables to determine the most relevant model parameters, namely the density of states width, the carrier mobility and the injection barrier height, by fitting experimental data from a sequence of relatively simple and inexpensive measurements to suitably devised numerical simulations. At each step of the proposed procedure only one parameter value is sought for, thus highly simplifying the numerical fitting and enhancing its robustness, reliability and accuracy. As a case study we consider a prototypical n-type organic polymer. A very satisfactory fitting of experimental measurements is obtained, and physically meaningful values for the aforementioned parameters are extracted.. 2017\n",

            "Reduced release probability prevents vesicle depletion and transmission failure at dynamin mutant synapses. Endocytic recycling of synaptic vesicles after exocytosis is critical for nervous system function. At synapses of cultured neurons that lack the two \"neuronal\" dynamins, dynamin 1 and 3, smaller excitatory postsynaptic currents are observed due to an impairment of the fission reaction of endocytosis that results in an accumulation of arrested clathrin-coated pits and a greatly reduced synaptic vesicle number. Surprisingly, despite a smaller readily releasable vesicle pool and fewer docked vesicles, a strong facilitation, which correlated with lower vesicle release probability, was observed upon action potential stimulation at such synapses. Furthermore, although network activity in mutant cultures was lower, Ca 2+/ calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) activity was unexpectedly increased, consistent with the previous report of an enhanced state of synapsin 1 phosphorylation at CaMKII-dependent sites in such neurons. These changes were partially reversed by overnight silencing of synaptic activity with tetrodotoxin, a treatment that allows progression of arrested endocytic pits to synaptic vesicles. Facilitation was also counteracted by CaMKII inhibition. These findings reveal a mechanism aimed at preventing synaptic transmission failure dueto vesicle depletionwhen recycling vesicle traffic is backed upby a defect in dynamin-dependent endocytosis and provide new insight into the coupling between endocytosis and exocytosis.. 2012\n"
