            "The “embreathment” illusion highlights the role of breathing in corporeal awareness. © 2020 American Physiological Society. All rights reserved.Recent theories posit that physiological signals contribute to corporeal awareness, the basic feeling that one has a body (body ownership) that acts according to one's will (body agency) and occupies a specific position (body location). Combining physiological recordings with immersive virtual reality, we found that an ecological mapping of real respiratory patterns onto a virtual body illusorily changes corporeal awareness. This new way of inducing a respiratory bodily illusion, called “embreathment,” revealed that breathing is almost as important as visual appearance for inducing body ownership and more important than any other cue for body agency. These effects were moderated by individual levels of interoception, as assessed through a standard heartbeat-counting task and a new “pneumoception” task. By showing that respiratory, visual, and spatial signals exert a specific and weighted influence on the fundamental feeling that one is an embodied agent, we pave the way for a comprehensive hierarchical model of corporeal awareness. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Our body is the only object we sense from the inside; however, it is unclear how much inner physiology contributes to the global sensation of having a body and controlling it. We combine respiration recordings with immersive virtual reality and find that making a virtual body breathe like the real body gives an illusory sense of ownership and agency over the avatar, elucidating the role of a key physiological process like breathing in corporeal awareness.. 2020\n",
            "Communication: Hole localization in Al-doped quartz SiO2 within ab initio hybrid-functional DFT. We investigate the long-standing problem of hole localization at the Al impurity in quartz SiO2, using a relatively recent DFT hybrid-functional method in which the exchange fraction is obtained ab initio, based on an analogy with the static many-body COHSEX approximation to the electron self-energy. As the amount of the admixed exact exchange in hybrid functionals has been shown to be determinant for properly capturing the hole localization, this problem constitutes a prototypical benchmark for the accuracy of the method, allowing one to assess to what extent self-interaction effects are avoided. We obtain good results in terms of description of the charge localization and structural distortion around the Al center, improving with respect to the more popular B3LYP hybrid-functional approach. We also discuss the accuracy of computed hyperfine parameters, by comparison with previous calculations based on other self-interaction-free methods, as well as experimental values. We discuss and rationalize the limitations of our approach in computing defect-related excitation energies in low-dielectric-constant insulators.. 2015\n",
            "Hysteresis and first-order phase transition in the two-dimensional electron gas. We report experimental evidence of the first-order phase transitions in the two-dimensional electron gas formed in a gated wide GaAs/AlGaAs quantum well at even-integer quantum-Hall states. At the filling factor values of v = 2, 4 and low temperatures, crossing of Landau levels through the application of the gate bias yields a suppression of the quantum-Hall-state excitation gap and hysteretical behaviour of the diagonal resistivity in up and down sweeps of the magnetic field. Detailed many-body calculations indicate the occurrence of a first-order phase transition and allow the determination of the exact properties of the electron ground states involved in the transition.. 2000\n",
            "Surface area enhancement by mesoporous silica deposition on microcantilever sensors for small molecule detection. We demonstrate here an easy and controlled technique to enhance the surface active area via highly porous inorganic nanostructure growth on the surface of a microcantilever. A dip-coating approach was used to deposit a continuous mesoporous silica thin film with an accessible pore size of around 8 nm. Both dynamic and static characterizations were performed showing a sensitivity enhancement to relative humidity up to two orders of magnitude with respect to bare cantilevers. The combination of the two analyses gave the possibility to link the adsorption kinetics to the direct quantification of the adsorbed layer mass. These results obtained with water molecules as test analyte pave the way to the use of these composite systems as improved mass and chemical detectors of other small target molecules.. 2015\n",
            "Oxytocin enhances basolateral amygdala activation and functional connectivity while processing emotional faces: preliminary findings in autistic vs non-autistic women. Oxytocin is hypothesized to promote social interactions by enhancing the salience of social stimuli. While previous neuroimaging studies have reported that oxytocin enhances amygdala activation to face stimuli in autistic men, effects in autistic women remain unclear. In this study, the influence of intranasal oxytocin on activation and functional connectivity of the basolateral amygdala - the brain's 'salience detector' - while processing emotional faces vs shapes was tested in 16 autistic and 21 non-autistic women by functional magnetic resonance imaging in a placebo-controlled, within-subject, cross-over design. In the placebo condition, minimal activation differences were observed between autistic and non-autistic women. However, significant drug × group interactions were observed for both basolateral amygdala activation and functional connectivity. Oxytocin increased left basolateral amygdala activation among autistic women (35-voxel cluster, Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) coordinates of peak voxel = -22 -10 -28; mean change = +0.079%, t = 3.159, PTukey = 0.0166) but not among non-autistic women (mean change = +0.003%, t = 0.153, PTukey = 0.999). Furthermore, oxytocin increased functional connectivity of the right basolateral amygdala with brain regions associated with socio-emotional information processing in autistic women, but not in non-autistic women, attenuating group differences in the placebo condition. Taken together, these findings extend evidence of oxytocin's effects on the amygdala to specifically include autistic women and specify the subregion of the effect.. 2022\n",
            "Controlling destructive quantum interference in tunneling junctions comprising self-assembled monolayers: Via bond topology and functional groups. Quantum interference effects (QI) are of interest in nano-scale devices based on molecular tunneling junctions because they can affect conductance exponentially through minor structural changes. However, their utilization requires the prediction and deterministic control over the position and magnitude of QI features, which remains a significant challenge. In this context, we designed and synthesized three benzodithiophenes based molecular wires; one linearly-conjugated, one cross-conjugated and one cross-conjugated quinone. Using eutectic Ga-In (EGaIn) and CP-AFM, we compared them to a well-known anthraquinone in molecular junctions comprising self-assembled monolayers (SAMs). By combining density functional theory and transition voltage spectroscopy, we show that the presence of an interference feature and its position can be controlled independently by manipulating bond topology and electronegativity. This is the first study to separate these two parameters experimentally, demonstrating that the conductance of a tunneling junction depends on the position and depth of a QI feature, both of which can be controlled synthetically.. 2018\n",
            "Measurement methods in atomic force microscopy. This chapter is introductory to the measurements: it explains different measurement techniques both for imaging and for force spectroscopy, on which most of the AFM experiments rely. It gives a general overview of the different techniques and of the output expected from the instrument; therefore it is, at a basic level, a good tool to properly start a new experiment. Concepts introduced in this chapter give the base for understanding the applications shown in the following chapters. Subheading 1 introduces the distinction between spectroscopy and imaging experiments and, within the last ones, between DC and AC mode. Subheading 2 is focused on DC mode (contact), explaining the topography and the lateral force channel. Subheading 3 introduces AC mode, both in noncontact and intermittent contact case. Phase imaging and force modulation are also discussed. Subheading 4 explains how the AFM can be used to measure local mechanical and adhesive properties of specimens by means of force spectroscopy technique. An overview on the state of the art and future trends in this field is also given.. 2011\n",
            "Nonacoustic high-frequency collective excitations in a ZrCuAl metallic glass. We report a combined theoretical and simulation study of collective excitations in the three-component metallic glass Zr46Cu46Al8. It is shown in that case how one can combine partial current time correlation functions to represent them via total mass and mass-concentration currents, which for the long-wavelength region separately describe hydrodynamic acoustic and nonhydrodynamic opticlike modes. We present dispersions of the longitudinal and transverse acoustic and optic modes over a wide range of wave numbers. Our theoretical analysis of dispersion and damping of three transverse short-wavelength modes sets the basis for the interpretation of already existing experimental data, where the presence of three modes has been disregarded leading to an overestimation of the alleged transverse mode damping.. 2022\n",
            "Multiscale modelling of claudin-based assemblies: A magnifying glass for novel structures of biological interfaces. Claudins (Cldns) define a family of transmembrane proteins that are the major determinants of the tight junction integrity and tissue selectivity. They promote the formation of either barriers or ion-selective channels at the interface between two facing cells, across the paracellular space. Multiple Cldn subunits form complexes that include cis- (intracellular) interactions along the membrane of a single cell and trans- (intercellular) interactions across adjacent cells. The first description of Cldn assemblies was provided by electron microscopy, while electrophysiology, mutagenesis and cell biology experiments addressed the functional role of different Cldn homologs. However, the investigation of the molecular details of Cldn subunits and complexes are hampered by the lack of experimental native structures, currently limited to Cldn15. The recent implementation of computer-based techniques greatly contributed to the elucidation of Cldn properties. Molecular dynamics simulations and docking calculations were extensively used to refine the first Cldn multimeric model postulated from the crystal structure of Cldn15, and contributed to the introduction of a novel, alternative, arrangement. While both these multimeric assemblies were found to account for the physiological properties of some family members, they gave conflicting results for others. In this review, we illustrate the major findings on Cldn-based systems that were achieved by using state-of-the-art computational methodologies. The information provided by these results could be useful to improve the characterization of the Cldn properties and help the design of new efficient strategies to control the paracellular transport of drugs or other molecules.. 2022\n",

            "The Invariance Hypothesis Implies Domain-Specific Regions in Visual Cortex. Is visual cortex made up of general-purpose information processing machinery, or does it consist of a collection of specialized modules? If prior knowledge, acquired from learning a set of objects is only transferable to new objects that share properties with the old, then the recognition system’s optimal organization must be one containing specialized modules for different object classes. Our analysis starts from a premise we call the invariance hypothesis: that the computational goal of the ventral stream is to compute an invariant-to-transformations and discriminative signature for recognition. The key condition enabling approximate transfer of invariance without sacrificing discriminability turns out to be that the learned and novel objects transform similarly. This implies that the optimal recognition system must contain subsystems trained only with data from similarly-transforming objects and suggests a novel interpretation of domain-specific regions like the fusiform face area (FFA). Furthermore, we can define an index of transformation-compatibility, computable from videos, that can be combined with information about the statistics of natural vision to yield predictions for which object categories ought to have domain-specific regions in agreement with the available data. The result is a unifying account linking the large literature on view-based recognition with the wealth of experimental evidence concerning domain-specific regions.. 2015\n",
            "Experimental scattershot boson sampling. Boson sampling is a computational task strongly believed to be hard for classical computers, but efficiently solvable by orchestrated bosonic interference in a specialized quantum computer. Current experimental schemes, however, are still insufficient for a convincing demonstration of the advantage of quantum over classical computation. A new variation of this task, scattershot boson sampling, leads to an exponential increase in speed of the quantum device, using a larger number of photon sources based on parametric down-conversion. This is achieved by having multiple heralded single photons being sent, shot by shot, into different random input ports of the interferometer. We report the first scattershot boson sampling experiments, where six different photon-pair sources are coupled to integrated photonic circuits. We use recently proposed statistical tools to analyze our experimental data, providing strong evidence that our photonic quantum simulator works as expected. This approach represents an important leap toward a convincing experimental demonstration of the quantum computational supremacy.. 2015\n",
            "Multicomponent polariton superfluidity in the optical parametric oscillator regime. Superfluidity, which is the ability of a liquid or gas to flow with zero viscosity, is one of the most remarkable implications of collective quantum coherence. In equilibrium systems such as liquid 4He and ultracold atomic gases, superfluid behavior conjugates diverse yet related phenomena, such as a persistent metastable flow in multiply connected geometries and the existence of a critical velocity for frictionless flow when hitting a static defect. The link between these different aspects of superfluid behavior is far less clear in driven-dissipative systems displaying collective coherence, such as microcavity polaritons, which raises important questions about their concurrency. With a joint theoretical and experimental study, we show that the scenario is particularly rich for polaritons driven in a three-fluid collective coherent regime, i.e., a so-called optical parametric oscillator. On the one hand, the spontaneous macroscopic coherence following the phase locking of the signal and idler fluids has been shown to be responsible for their simultaneous quantized flow metastability. On the other hand, we show here that the pump, signal, and idler have distinct responses when hitting a static defect; while the signal displays modulations that are barely perceptible, the ones appearing in the pump and idler are determined by their mutual coupling due to nonlinear and parametric processes.. 2015\n",
            "Sustainability of (H2Â +Â CH4) by anaerobic digestion via EROI approach and LCA evaluations. The contents of this Chapter focus on the theoretical sustainable energy approach and its application to hydrogen and methane production, on the basis of results obtained from experimental tests on the Anaerobic Digestion (AD) technology. The evaluation of sustainability is pursued through the life cycle assessment (LCA), energy return on investment (EROI) and energy payback time (EPT) approaches. The EROI and EPT parameters are defined and applied to score the sustainability of the H2/CH4 energy carrier. The evaluation of the indirect energy following a life cycle assessment is consistent for the sustainability analysis. The sustainability of AD technology strongly depends on the reactor diameter: for values lower than 1 m the technology is not able to sustain the well-being of the society; the effect of the insulating material as well as the labor could be very important, and in this respect, thus, a sensitivity analysis on the sustainability is reported.. 2013\n",

The Hartree-Fock paradigm of bilayer quantum Hall states with finite tunneling at filling factor ν = 1 has full pseudospin ferromagnetic order with all the electrons in the lowest symmetric Landau level. Inelastic light scattering measurements of low energy spin excitations reveal major departures from the paradigm at relatively large tunneling gaps. The results indicate the emergence of a novel correlated quantum Hall state at ν = 1 characterized by reduced pseudospin order.

            "Absorption and emission spectral shapes of a prototype dye in water by combining classical/dynamical and quantum/static approaches. We study the absorption and emission electronic spectra in an aqueous solution of N-methyl-6-oxyquinolinium betaine (MQ), an interesting dye characterized by a large change of polarity and H-bond ability between the ground (S<inf>0</inf>) and the excited (S<inf>1</inf>) states. To that end we compare alternative approaches based either on explicit solvent models and density functional theory (DFT)/molecular-mechanics (MM) calculations or on DFT calculations on clusters models embedded in a polarizable continuum (PCM). In the first approach (Cl<inf>MD</inf>), the spectrum is computed according to the classical Franck-Condon principle, from the dispersion of the time-dependent (TD)-DFT vertical transitions at selected snapshots of molecular dynamics (MD) on the initial state. In the cluster model (Q<inf>st</inf>) the spectrum is simulated by computing the quantum vibronic structure, estimating the inhomogeneous broadening from state-specific TD-DFT/PCM solvent reorganization energies. While both approaches provide absorption and emission spectral shapes in nice agreement with experiment, the Stokes shift is perfectly reproduced by Q<inf>st</inf> calculations if S<inf>0</inf> and S<inf>1</inf> clusters are selected on the grounds of the MD trajectory. Furthermore, Q<inf>st</inf> spectra better fit the experimental line shape, mostly in absorption. Comparison of the predictions of the two approaches is very instructive: the positions of Q<inf>st</inf> and Cl<inf>MD</inf> spectra are shifted due to the different solvent models and the Cl<inf>MD</inf> spectra are narrower than the Q<inf>st</inf> ones, because MD underestimates the width of the vibrational density of states of the high-frequency modes coupled to the electronic transition. On the other hand, both Q<inf>st</inf> and Cl<inf>MD</inf> approaches highlight that the solvent has multiple and potentially opposite effects on the spectral width, so that the broadening due to solute-solvent vibrations and electrostatic interaction with bulk solvent is (partially) counterbalanced by a narrowing of the contribution due to the solute vibrational modes. Q<inf>st</inf> analysis evidences a pure quantum broadening effect of the spectra in water due to vibronic progressions along the solute/solvent H-bonds.. 2015\n",
            "REST/NRSF-mediated intrinsic homeostasis protects neuronal networks from hyperexcitability. Intrinsic homeostasis enables neuronal circuits to maintain activity levels within an appropriate range by modulating neuronal voltage-gated conductances, but the signalling pathways involved in this process are largely unknown. We characterized the process of intrinsic homeostasis induced by sustained electrical activity in cultured hippocampal neurons based on the activation of the Repressor Element-1 Silencing Transcription Factor/Neuron-Restrictive Silencer Factor (REST/NRSF). We showed that 4-aminopyridine-induced hyperactivity enhances the expression of REST/NRSF, which in turn, reduces the expression of voltage-gated Na + channels, thereby decreasing the neuronal Na + current density. This mechanism plays an important role in the downregulation of the firing activity at the single-cell level, re-establishing a physiological spiking activity in the entire neuronal network. Conversely, interfering with REST/NRSF expression impaired this homeostatic response. Our results identify REST/NRSF as a critical factor linking neuronal activity to the activation of intrinsic homeostasis and restoring a physiological level of activity in the entire neuronal network. © 2013 European Molecular Biology Organization.. 2013\n",
            "Supramolecular polycationic hydrogels with high swelling capacity prepared by partial methacrylation of polyethyleneimine. Methacrylation of branched polyethyleneimine (PEI) was performed to generate modified polycationic macromolecules that self-assemble in water into highly swollen supramolecular hydrogels with tunable hydrophilicity and microstructure. The properties of the supramolecular hydrogels, in terms of swelling and porosity, were controlled during synthesis by the extent of methacrylation of the starting PEI macromolecules. The methacrylation reaction was conducted under several conditions, and the methacrylated PEI (PEI-MA) molecules were investigated by FTIR and NMR to relate the reaction parameters to the amount of methacrylate moieties on the modified polymer. The hydrogel morphology and its dynamic nature arising from the non-covalent interactions among the PEI-MA macromolecules were characterized by small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and fluorescence microscopy at different temperatures, which enabled visualization of the large interconnected microcavities of the supramolecular gel network.. 2015\n",
            "Neurodegeneration as an RNA disorder. Neurodegenerative diseases constitute one of the single most important public health challenges of the coming decades, and yet we presently have only a limited understanding of the underlying genetic, cellular and molecular causes. As a result, no effective disease-modifying therapies are currently available, and no method exists to allow detection at early disease stages, and as a result diagnoses are only made decades after disease pathogenesis, by which time the majority of physical damage has already occurred. Since the sequencing of the human genome, we have come to appreciate that the transcriptional output of the human genome is extremely rich in non-protein coding RNAs (ncRNAs). This heterogeneous class of transcripts is widely expressed in the nervous system, and is likely to play many crucial roles in the development and functioning of this organ. Most exciting, evidence has recently been presented that ncRNAs play central, but hitherto unappreciated roles in neurodegenerative processes. Here, we review the diverse available evidence demonstrating involvement of ncRNAs in neurodegenerative diseases, and discuss their possible implications in the development of therapies and biomarkers for these conditions. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.. 2012\n",

Since a few years, nanotechnology-based approaches for miRNA quantification are emerging at fast pace but there is urgent need to go beyond the proof-of-concept stage.

Here we present the observation of inter-shell excitations in GaAs/AlGaAs nanofabricated QDs containing four electrons. The ground state with four electrons dictated by Hund's rule is a triplet with total spin S = 1 so that peculiar to this configuration there are two monopole inter-shell spin modes with changes ΔS = ±1 that connect the triplet state to the excited states with S = 0 and S = 2, respectively.

The radiation used in particle therapy treatments produces secondary particles, either neutral or charged, when interacting with the patient body. The particles that exit from the body can be used to provide a fast feedback on the treatment plans. Here we report the measurements of prompt-γ ray fluxes produced by the interaction of a 220 MeV/u carbon ion beam at GSI, Darmstadt, with a polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) target. The photons were detected by means of an array of LYSO crystals, allowing for a measurement of time of flight and released energy. Different angular configurations were explored, placing the prompt-γ detector at 60°, 90°, and 120° with respect to the primary beam direction. The prompt-γ energy spectra have been obtained for the different angular configurations after having taken into account the detector resolution by means of an unfolding procedure tuned with a dedicated Monte Carlo simulation. The integrated fluxes (over the full 4π solid angle), in the 2-10 MeV prompt-γ ray energy range, at 60°, 90° and 120°, are measured as Φγ(60°) = (6.7±1.7) × 10-3 sr-1, Φγ(90°) = (6.3±2.1) × 10-3 sr-1 and Φγ(120°) = (4.4±1.1) × 10-3 sr-1 respectively.. 2015\n",
            "Altered Traffic of Cardiolipin during Apoptosis: Exposure on the Cell Surface as a Trigger for \"antiphospholipid Antibodies\". Apoptosis has been reported to induce changes in the remodelling of membrane lipids; after death receptor engagement, specific changes of lipid composition occur not only at the plasma membrane, but also in intracellular membranes. This paper focuses on one important aspect of apoptotic changes in cellular lipids, namely, the redistribution of the mitochondria-specific phospholipid, cardiolipin (CL). CL predominantly resides in the inner mitochondrial membrane, even if the rapid remodelling of its acyl chains and the subsequent degradation occur in other membrane organelles. After death receptor stimulation, CL appears to concentrate into mitochondrial \"raft-like\" microdomains at contact sites between inner and outer mitochondrial membranes, leading to local oligomerization of proapoptotic proteins, including Bid. Clustering of Bid in CL-enriched contacts sites is interconnected with pathways of CL remodelling that intersect membrane traffic routes dependent upon actin. In addition, CL association with cytoskeleton protein vimentin was observed. Such novel association also indicated that CL molecules may be expressed at the cell surface following apoptotic stimuli. This observation adds a novel implication of biomedical relevance. The association of CL with vimentin at the cell surface may represent a \"new\" target antigen in the context of the apoptotic origin of anti-vimentin/CL autoantibodies in Antiphospholipid Syndrome.. 2015\n",

The gene encoding ribosomal protein L1 in Xenopus laevis is known to be posttranscriptionally regulated; the third intron can be processed from the pre-mRNA in two alternative ways, resulting either in the production of L1 mRNA or in the release of a small nucleolar RNA (U16). The formation of splicing complexes was studied in vivo by oocyte microinjection. We show that spliceosome assembly is impaired on the L1 third intron and that the low efficiency of the process is due to the presence of suboptimal consensus sequences. An analysis of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) distribution was also performed, revealing a distinct site for hnRNP C binding proximal to the 5' end of the L1 third intron. Cleavage, leading to the production of the small nucleolar RNA U16, occurs in the same position, and we show that conditions under which hnRNP C binding is reduced result in an increase of the processing activity of the intron.. 1994\n",

It is further found that a power-law turbulent energy spectrum E(k)∼k-n generates metric fluctuations scaling as xn-2, where x is the four-dimensional spacelike distance from an arbitrary origin in Minkowski spacetime, highlighting the onset of metric singularities whenever n<2. Finally, the effect of metric fluctuations on the geodesic motion of test particles is also discussed as a potential technique to extract information on the spectral characteristics of fluctuating spacetime.. 2022\n",

In this study, we investigate the morphology and mechanical features of Octopus vulgaris suckers, which may serve as a model for the creation of a new generation of attachment devices. Octopus suckers attach to a wide range of substrates in wet conditions, including rough surfaces. This amazing feature is made possible by the sucker's tissues, which are pliable to the substrate profile. Previous studies have described a peculiar internal structure that plays a fundamental role in the attachment and detachment processes of the sucker. In this work, we present a mechanical characterization of the tissues involved in the attachment process, which was performed using microindentation tests. We evaluated the elasticity modulus and viscoelastic parameters of the natural tissues (E ∼ 10 kPa) and measured the mechanical properties of some artificial materials that have previously been used in soft robotics. Such a comparison of biological prototypes and artificial material that mimics octopus-sucker tissue is crucial for the design of innovative artificial suction cups for use in wet environments. We conclude that the properties of the common elastomers that are generally used in soft robotics are quite dissimilar to the properties of biological suckers. © 2013 The Authors.

            "Presynaptic muscarinic receptors reduce synaptic depression and facilitate its recovery at hippocampal GABAergic synapses. Hippocampal gamma oscillation, involved in cognitive processes, can be induced by muscarinic acetylcholine receptors activation and depends in large part on the activation of γ-aminobutyric acidergic (GABAergic) interneurons. The precise role of the modulatory action of muscarinic receptors on GABAergic transmission still remains unclear due to the great heterogeneity of observed effects. We have examined the presynaptic and postsynaptic mechanisms involved. Methacholine induces a down-regulation of evoked inhibitory postsynaptic currents (eIPSCs) not associated with the change of postsynaptic receptors. The significant decrease in the paired-pulse depression strongly suggested a presynaptic mechanism of action. We have used cumulative amplitude profile analysis to show that the impairment of eIPSCs is not related to a decreased size of the readily releasable pool, but rather depends on the reduced release probability by a down-modulation of voltage-gated calcium channels. The decreased neurotransmitter release probability only partially accounts for the dramatic reduction in the rate of synaptic depression evoked by short- and long-lasting tetanic stimuli. This effect is accompanied by a significant enhancement in the rate of recovery from synaptic depression that demonstrates the reinforcement of the synaptic recycling processes. These results show that muscarinic modulation of hippocampal GABAergic synapses confers a greater resistance to sustain periods of intense synaptic activity in the gamma frequency range. © 2013 The Author.

Reported in this paper is, to our knowledge, the first theoretical investigation of three-dimensional (3D) imaging properties in a confocal microscope under ultra-short-pulse illumination. Time-resolved, time-averaged and interferometric imaging modes in reflection and transmission systems are considered. The concept of the 3D transfer function is used to understand the imaging performance of the system. In the case of a 10 fs pulse, the spatial frequency bandwidth in the axial direction is twice that for a system under continuous-wave (CW) illumination, while the spatial frequency bandwidth in the transverse direction is increased by only 10%. As a result, axial resolution can be improved by approximately 30%, compared with the limiting value under CW laser illumination of the same wavelength as the pulsed beam. © 1995 Taylor & Francis Ltd.. 1995\n",
            "Direct Formation of Hard-Magnetic Tetrataenite in Bulk Alloy Castings. Currently, predominant high-performance permanent magnets contain rare-earth elements. In the search for rare-earth-free alternates, body-centered tetragonal Fe–Ni is notable. The ordering to form this phase from the usual cubic close-packed Fe-Ni is understood to be possible only below a critical temperature, commonly accepted to be 593 K. The ordering is first demonstrated by using neutron irradiation to accelerate atomic diffusion. The tetragonal phase, designated as the mineral tetrataenite, is found in Fe-based meteorites, its formation attributed to ultra-slow cooling. Despite many attempts with diverse approaches, bulk synthesis of tetrataenite has not been reported. Here it is shown that with appropriate alloy compositions, bulk synthesis of tetrataenite is possible, even in conventional casting at cooling rates 11‒15 orders of magnitude higher than in meteorites. The barrier to obtaining tetrataenite (slow ordering from cubic close-packed to body-centered tetragonal) is circumvented, opening a processing window for potential rare-earth-free permanent magnets. The formation of tetrataenite on industrially practicable timescales also throws into question the interpretation of its formation in meteorites and their associated cooling rates.. 2023\n",
            "Spray deposition effects on superhydrophobicity and durability of nanocoatings. Superhydrophobic coatings fabricated by spray deposition techniques have recently gained prominence, especially in applications where large surface area coatings are desired. While the spray-casting heights and air pressures can have substantial influence on the superhydrophobicity and wear durability of the coatings, the effects have not been previously investigated in detail. To address this lack of knowledge, this study sought to systematically investigate these effects for polyurethane clay-fluorine nanocomposite coatings in terms of water contact angle, roll-off angle and mechanical linear abrasion. The results showed that coatings fabricated at high spray-casting heights and low air pressures (longer droplet flight time) were more superhydrophobic than the coatings fabricated at low spray-casting heights and high air pressures (shorter droplet flight time). However, the later coatings were remarkably more resistant to strong linear abrasion as compared to the former. By balancing these application parameters, the authors showed that a combination of durability and superhydrophobicity can be achieved.. 2014\n",

Present modeling of the system includes effects such as scattering of light in tissues. However, absorption effects were often neglected in the model. They may be significant depending on the tissue type and the wavelength of the light source. We present a study where the effects of absorption in light propagation in biological tissue were examined in the theoretical modeling of OCT based on the single-scattering model. OCT M-scans were performed on liquid tissue phantoms at 1% concentration. In order to mimic the effects of absorption, India ink was added to the solution. Different concentrations of Indian ink were used to vary the absorption coefficient in the tissue phantoms. Estimation of the absorption, scattering coefficients from the OCT signal were obtained. Substantial reduction in the slope of the logarithmic OCT signal was observed when India ink was introduced to the liquid tissue phantoms. The results suggest that the effects of the absorption clearly affected the estimation of the overall extinction coefficient. In order to improve the accuracy of estimation of these characteristics, absorption effects should be taken into account. © 2007 SPIE-OSA.. 2007\n",
            "The temporal coupling effect: Preparation and execution of bimanual reaching movements. The study of bimanual movements has allowed to describe an interesting phenomenon known as the bimanual coupling effect: a lack of independence between the two hands that induces an interference process, which has been reported in both the spatial and temporal domain. Here, we studied for the first time the electro-cortical activity of the temporal bimanual coupling effect, specifically focused on the motor preparation of the two hands movements. Participants performed congruent movements, with both hands heading towards easy or difficult targets, and incongruent movements, with the two hands heading to separate targets (i.e. left to the easy target and right to the difficult target). Motor Related Cortical Potentials (MRCPs) showed no effect of conditions or difficulty on the early phase of the activity (posterior and anterior BP). Additionally, the two hands were prepared together, as if a single movement was about to start. As such, behavioral results showed strong synchronization between the hands, which always tended to start and end their movement together. Importantly, the effect of movement difficulty was present at the movement onset and just after it when the movement unfolded. Coherently with behavioral results, difficult movements generated a strong Post-motor potential (N4), more prominent when the right hand was heading towards the difficult target. Our findings show that bimanual movements are actually planned and programmed as a single motor program, but movement difficulty emerges in the execution of the action.. 2017\n",
